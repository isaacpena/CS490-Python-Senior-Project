Big news - Budget just passed!
	Do not underestimate the UNITY within the Republican Party!
	Ed Gillespie will be a great Governor of Virginia. His opponent doesn't even show up to meetings/work and will be VERY weak on crime!
	Ed Gillespie will turn the really bad Virginia economy #'s around and fast. Strong on crime he might even save our great statues/heritage!
	Will be another Sean success! https://t.co/SlNTENvJLA

	Jeff Flake with an 18% approval rating in Arizona said "a lot of my colleagues have spoken out." Really they just gave me a standing O!
	Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class business &amp; JOBS
	The meeting with Republican Senators yesterday outside of Flake and Corker was a love fest with standing ovations and great ideas for USA!
	The reason Flake and Corker dropped out of the Senate race is very simple they had zero chance of being elected. Now act so hurt &amp; wounded!
	"Clinton campaign &amp; DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President." @FoxNews
	So nice being with Republican Senators today. Multiple standing ovations! Most are great people who want big Tax Cuts and success for U.S.

	Sen. Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee &amp; look how poorly the U.S. has done. He doesn't have a clue as.....
	Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker who couldn't get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee will now fight Tax Cuts plus!
	...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!
	Bob Corker who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal &amp; couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee is now fighting Tax Cuts....

	Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem showing total disrespect to our Flag &amp; Country.  No leadership in NFL!
	There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works and it stays!
	It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS even worse! Lost cred.
	Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party a disaster for Dems. You watch her in action &amp; vote R!

	Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side not mine!
	Keep hearing about "tiny" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN ABC NBC &amp; CBS?
	Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.

	I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she as a representative is killing the Democrat Party!
	Budget that just passed is a really big deal especially in terms of what will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history - MSM barely covered!

	.@foxandfriends "Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation"
	Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all)?
	Uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
	Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes but who knows?
	"46% of Americans think the Media is inventing stories about Trump &amp; his Administration." @FoxNews   It is actually much worse than this!

	Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!
	The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
	As it has turned out James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
	The Democrats will only vote for Tax Increases. Hopefully all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.
	...people not interviewed including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?

	Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs. "We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history."
	ObamaCare is causing such grief and tragedy for so many. It is being dismantled but in the meantime premiums &amp; deductibles are way up!
	Money pouring into Insurance Companies profits under the guise of ObamaCare is over. They have made a fortune.Dems must get smart &amp; deal!
	Many people talking with much agreement on my Iran speech today. Participants in the deal are making lots of money on trade with Iran!
	Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts.

	With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
	Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction made up to demean. NBC = CNN!
	It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
	The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases &amp; soft crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history &amp; the WALL!
	It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.Need tax cuts
	...if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds. #MAGA

	With Jemele Hill at the mike it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked" in fact tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
	Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST
	The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure bordersthey don't care about safety for U.S.A.

	More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
	Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very "unfunny" &amp; repetitive material always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?
	...contributions. The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems and much of it by my wonderful small donors. I am working hard for them!
	Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost. It discusses the enthusiasm of "Trump" voters through campaign....
	Ralph Northamwho is running for Governor of Virginiais fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs &amp; sanctuary cities.  Vote Ed Gillespie!

	...It's old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed with billions of dollars....
	Texas &amp; Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure &amp; massive debt is in deep trouble..
	Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthem
	General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
	.@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG ANTHEM COUNTRY. Total lie!
	#StandForOurAnthem
	The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night. Important meetings taking place today. Big tax cuts &amp; reform.
	The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
	Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
	So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans. They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
	Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.https://t.co/KJ886okyfC
	Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!
	Alaska Arizona Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal. 7 years of Repeal &amp; Replace and some Senators not there.
	Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
	Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
	Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!
	...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
	If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag &amp; Country you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
	Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won't be around much longer!
	Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!
	Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
	Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!
	Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.) She is a truly great representative for our country! https://t.co/yFv0WIjgby
	...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
	If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
	Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
	It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama. What great people what a crowd! Vote Luther on Tuesday.
	Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare worst in the country. Deductibles high people angry! Lisa M comes through.
	I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
	Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control &amp;  management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
	Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad
	John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal &amp; Replace. Let Arizona down!
	Heading to Alabama now big crowd!
	Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights. Fantastic job!
	#USAatUNGA#UNGA https://t.co/miT2Lj7Q90
	Will be in Alabama tonight. Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement but will be very close. He loves Alabama and so do I!
	The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next she was a bad candidate!
	The Russia hoax continues now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
	Thank you! https://t.co/hlz48RLkIf
	Kim Jong Un of North Korea who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people will be tested like never before!
	Rand Paul or whoever votes against Hcare Bill will forever (future political campaigns) be known as "the Republican who saved ObamaCare."
	A big day for the U.S. at the United Nations!
	Senator Luther Strange has gone up a lot in the polls since I endorsed him a month ago. Now a close runoff. He will be great in D.C.
	It was wonderful to have President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine with us in New York City today. #UNGAhttps://t.co/UKOMUj0ZuL https://t.co/GpkERy8WiP
	Governor @RicardoRossello- We are with you and the people of Puerto Rico. Stay safe! #PRStrong
	Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their Health(care) he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!
	The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther. He won't let you down!
	I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal &amp; Replace.
	Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like "Big" Luther Strange. Smart tough on crime borders &amp; trade loves Vets &amp; Military. Tuesday!
	On behalf of all Americans I want to wish Jewish families many blessings in the New Year. https://t.co/m4VWxYvONx https://t.co/iYG1G8GaLN

	Looking forward to Friday night in the Great State of Alabama. I am supporting "Big" Luther Strange because he was so loyal &amp; helpful to me!
	I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal &amp; Replace ObamaCare. Money direct to States!
	Rand Paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare. Graham-Cassidy Bill is GREAT! Ends Ocare!
	Thank you  @foxandfriends - great show!
	The world is noticing thanks! https://t.co/2NL6SlWnmH

	ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!
	We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive &amp; nasty!
	The travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific-but stupidly that would not be politically correct!
	Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off &amp; use better!
	Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!
	With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation rather than 51. Can't get votes END NOW!

	Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan - a curse on the U.S. &amp; its people...
	Spoke to President of Mexico to give condolences on terrible earthquake. Unable to reach for 3 days b/c of his cell phone reception at site.
	Just left Florida for D.C. The people and spirit in THAT GREAT STATE is unbelievable. Damage horrific but will be better than ever!
	Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard FEMA etc. A real disaster much work to do!
	...They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age. Plus BIG border security
	Does anybody really want to throw out good educated and accomplished young people who have jobs some serving in the military? Really!.....
	The WALL which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built.
	No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote.
	The "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but in the end had no game!
	Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!
	China has a business tax rate of 15%. We should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy. Jobs and wages!
	With Irma and Harvey devastation Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress go!
	I will be traveling to Florida tomorrow to meet with our great Coast Guard FEMA and many of the brave first responders &amp; others.
	The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut &amp; Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!

	Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others).
	Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!
	...never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!
	Republicans sorry but I've been hearing about Repeal &amp; Replace for 7 years didn't happen! Even worse the Senate Filibuster Rule will....
	Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard!
	Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion perhaps bigger than we have ever seen. Be safe and get out of its wayif possible. Federal G is ready!
	We will confront ANY challenge no matter how strong the winds or high the water. Im proud to stand with Presidents for #OneAmericaAppeal.

	South Korea is finding as I have told them that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work they only understand one thing!
	..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China which is trying to help but with little success.
	North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.....

	Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews...maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition!
	Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders. Many decisions made including on Afghanistan.
	I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S

	Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary! The courts must give us back our protective rights. Have to be tough!
	The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult. They use the courts and associated delay at all times. Must stop!
	Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert &amp; closely watching for any sign of trouble. Our borders are far tougher than ever before!
	Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
	The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona Spain and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough &amp; strong we love you!

	Many meetings today in Bedminster including with Secretary Linda M and Small Business. Job numbers are looking great!
	Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake who is WEAK on borders crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!
	The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate bigotry etc. Shame!
	...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!

	Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!
	Wow Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement. Now in September runoff. Strong on Wall &amp; Crime!
	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
	Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!
	Congratulations John! https://t.co/vhmv7Qoutk
	Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama. Exciting race!
	Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
	For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!
	Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange he will be great!
	@foxandfriends According to report just out President Obama knew about Russian interference 3 years ago but he didn't want to anger Russia!
	Senator Luther Strange who is doing a great job for the people of Alabama will be on @foxandfriends at 7:15. Tough on crime borders etc.
	Feels good to be home after seven months but the White House is very special there is no place like it... and the U.S. is really my home!
	Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
	Leaving for New York City and meetings on military purchases and trade.
	Big day in Washington D.C. even though White House &amp; Oval Office are being renovated. Great trade deals coming for American workers!
	.@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher &amp; higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back &amp; LOWER PRICES!
	Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Councilhe will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
	The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast!
	Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement. He is strong on Border &amp; Wall the military tax cuts &amp; law enforcement.
	Heading to Washington this morning. Much work to do. Focus on trade and military. #MAGA
	Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today and best regards to all of those injured in Charlottesville Virginia. So sad!
	Deepest condolences to the families &amp; fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.

	Can you believe that Mitch McConnell who has screamed Repeal &amp; Replace for 7 years couldn't get it done. Must Repeal &amp; Replace ObamaCare!
	Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal &amp; Replace why not done?
	...Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!
	My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....
	Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!
	After 200 days rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..not even close! Don't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls!
	E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.

	How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources) remain in business?
	The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!

	Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....
	Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist!
	Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings.
	Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN ABC NBC CBS NYTIMES &amp; WAPO the Trump base is getting stronger!
	... Supreme Court pick economic enthusiasm deregulation &amp; so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together. Will never change!
	...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story record Stock Market border security military strength jobs.....
	The Trump base is far bigger &amp;  stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn Iowa Ohio.......
	The failing @nytimes which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized) is totally inept!
	Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.

	If ObamaCare is hurting people &amp; it is why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp; why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
	Don't give up Republican Senators the World is watching: Repeal &amp; Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option) get Cross State Lines &amp; more.
	...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
	I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet...
	I love reading about all of the "geniuses" who were so instrumental in my election success. Problem is most don't exist. #Fake News! MAGA
	Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal &amp; Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
	U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election!
	If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!
	After seven years of "talking" Repeal &amp; Replace the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare!
	If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute. They are laughing at R's. MAKE CHANGE!
	....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart!
	Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
	The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
	Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW! It is killing the R Party allows 8 Dems to control country. 200 Bills sit in Senate. A JOKE!

	If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority not senseless 60...
	3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal. Watch!

	Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
	So why aren't the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered A.G. looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes &amp; Russia relations?
	After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia."
	Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News!
	Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+. S.C.reg cuttingStock M jobsborder etc. = TRUE!
	If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
	It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive is bad!
	It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President.

	The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is &amp; it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!
	I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
	The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
	Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!
	The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
	With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!
	As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
	We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!
	Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now &amp; work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!

	The W.H. is functioning perfectly focused on HealthCare Tax Cuts/Reform &amp; many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
	Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!
	.@WashTimes states "Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump."
	ISIS is on the run &amp; will soon be wiped out of Syria &amp; Iraq illegal border crossings are way down (75%) &amp; MS 13 gangs are being removed.
	Remember when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media often times those sources are made up and do not exist.
	My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!
	My son Donald will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country!
	Big wins against ISIS!
	Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking. Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!

	The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees. They  can't win so all they do is slow things down &amp; obstruct!
	If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her motheras her mother gave our country away the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!
	When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!
	I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!
	James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
	The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can&amp; did!
	Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!
	For years even as a "civilian" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!
	Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian &amp; Syrian problems are solved!
	...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
	...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA &amp; FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER and were rejected still don't....
	Putin &amp; I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking &amp; many other negative things will be guarded..
	...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
	I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
	The G 20 Summit was a great success for the U.S. - Explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made. Will get done!

	Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!
	The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?

	The #AmazonWashingtonPost sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!
	Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong I know the subject well &amp; want victory for U.S.
	The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!
	I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right unlike OCare!
	With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard!
	So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS &amp; ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
	Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
	Wow CNN had to retract big story on "Russia" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!
	Great day for America's future Security and Safety courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. I will keep fighting for the American people &amp; WIN!
	From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election."  Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!
	Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
	Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp; burn!
	..under a magnifying glass they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion &amp; no obstruction. I should be given apology!
	The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
	...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke" he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
	The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
	The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
	I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!
	Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
	I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
	Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
	Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
	Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums &amp; deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan?
	Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
	I've helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills mostly with no Democratic support and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations. Nice!

	...whether there are "tapes" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey but I did not make and do not have any such recordings.
	With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance intercepts unmasking and illegal leaking of information I have no idea...
	I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
	...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
	...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!
	By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
	Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump &amp; Russia.

	.@foxandfriends  Dems are taking forever to approve my people including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.
	In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!
	The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!
	The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to S.C.
	People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but I am calling it what we need and what it is a TRAVEL BAN!
	Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
	At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"
	We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don't get smart it will only get worse
	Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K. we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!

	People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
	The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
	Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
	When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
	CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
	CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

	No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
	Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world.
	Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety.
	Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
	Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
	Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

	Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
	If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
	While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
	Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.

	If I win the Presidency we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
	Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
	Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
	On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
	Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

	Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
	Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don't want congrats I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart!
	Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough smart &amp; vigilant?

	I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
	Katie Couric the third rate reporter who has been largely forgotten should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

	If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent say good bye to the Supreme Court!
	Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser but if the GOP can't control their own then they are not a party. Be tough R's!
	Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
	Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
	Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
	I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
	The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
	The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- &amp; I'm beating her.

	How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?

	Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?
	Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
	Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
	Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.
	Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clintons flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
	Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud!
	I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
	Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:https://t.co/lSDE7LHc95
	I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

	If @TedCruz doesnt clean up his act stop cheating &amp; doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
	After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads.

	Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
	Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
	Cruz says I supported TARP which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
	The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
	.@BrentBozell one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
	Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS the Chinese or with Putin.

	This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.

	For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
	NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
	Once again #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.

	John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
	Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud!
	John Kasich fell right into President Obamas trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
	Doesnt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - hes almost last.
	I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last!
	Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
	Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
	I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I dont want to waste my money.
	John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
	John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
	Governor Kasich whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

	Thank you to @NYPost's Robert Rorke for the really nice review of #SNL. So many enjoyed it - very gratifying! https://t.co/TT29WgelUT
	Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration &amp; in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA!
	Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat &amp; chugging water. He choked!
	Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldnt hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
	A great evening in Springfield Illinois. Thank you for all of the support! #Trump2016 https://t.co/mqOfuI08PX
	Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr. Nobody could have done it better!
	Getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial. https://t.co/asHECYFBRv
	Carson now admits his friend named "Bob" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!) no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!
	With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
	Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists. I didnt change my opinion but treated them w/ respect. Shame! https://t.co/O9Kgfi5xcH
	Also tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.

	Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time &amp; money!

	.@JebBush is slashing campaign salaries people making millions. If he can't manage his campaign how can he manage our countries finances?
	.@JebBush had a tiny 300 person crowd at Senator Tim Scott's forum. I had thousands and they had real passion! https://t.co/osBW3TM4UO
	.@JebBush is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign &amp; not enough talking about America's future.
	Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live! #TrumpToday
	I will be doing the @TodayShow live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning. #TrumpToday

	.@JebBush like it or not our country needs more energy and spirit than you can provide! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
	No @JebBush youre pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brothers term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down.
	.@JebBushAt the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice &amp; did not mention the WTC came down during his watch 9/11.

	.@ChuckTodd just informed us that my interview last week on @MeetthePress was their highest rated show in 4 years. Congrats!
	I was so happy when I heard that @Politico one of the most dishonest political outlets is losing a fortune. Pure scum!
	.@EWErickson ran @RedState into the ground. A change was necessary. Congratulations to @RedState and good luck in the future!
	.@EWErickson is a total low life--- read his past tweets. A dummy with no "it" factor. Will fade fast.
	Just found out I won the Rockingham County Republican Booth Straw Poll at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire this past weekend. 39% ---Wow!
	Tune in to see me on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos at 10am ET. Enjoy!

	.....Has worst attendance record in Senate- rarely there to vote on a bill! @marcorubio
	.@MarcoRubio is weak on illegal immigration and will allow anyone into the country.....
	Dishonest @politico just called to say that none of the polls including Fox NBC CNN Zogby &amp; Morning Consult matter. Serious haters.
	At the Old Post Office- http://t.co/8Rs1fbcAIz
	.....Ahead of schedule and under budget! Will be in Oklahoma tonight!
	Great reception in D.C. At the Values Voter Summit. Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office...
	The failing @politico news outlet which I hear is losing lots of money is really dishonest!
	.@politico which is not read or respected by many may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.
	.@FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV. Unheard of!
	Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews. He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!

	I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium! Unbelievable people.
	Too many people on stage for debate. @RandPaul at 11th with 2% in @RealClearNews shouldn't be allowed to participate.
	I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul but his son @RandPaul didn't get the right gene.
	Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.

	Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo' the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? ....
	Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press. Isn't he pathetic? Love watching him fail!
	Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price.  I told you so!
