	@elspethreeve Thanks. Yeah alt-right is tricky because the label's been contested/co-opted by outright white supremacists.
	8. White supremacists also have a strong tendency to fixate on Jews controlling the US government. Few standard Republicans do.

	5. A Republican might advocate policies that advantage whites, but would not identify himself as a spokesman for white rights.
