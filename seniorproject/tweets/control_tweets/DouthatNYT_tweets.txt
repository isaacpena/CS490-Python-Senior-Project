	@SethAMandel @EsotericCD Progressives aren't militant atheists! Only weird Bay Area rationalists are militant atheists!
	@DamonLinker And doing so is good for democracy, since it forces the other two parties to shift and adapt.
	@DamonLinker There was a time when people started third parties knowing that they'd probably get 15 percent!
	Which speaks well of them, since Trump is in fact bad, while Daniel Dennett is almost certainly wrong, and even risibly so.
	Liberals do like being right in a "loud, boring, pointless way." But they don't all believe Daniel Dennett the way they believe Trump's bad.
	There's a reason that Sam Harris transitioned to being a guru of "secular" spirituality. No God, but lots of meditation! It's scientific!
	But in the end the liberal consensus is agnostic spirituality, not militant atheism. So New Atheists weren't exactly preaching to the choir.
	The New Atheists were popular when ppl were scared of both "theocons" and Islamic radicalism and enjoyed seeing both scabrously attacked.
	Saying "there is no God" differs from being anti-Trump or anti-racist in that even lots of secular ppl kind of suspect there might be a God.
	If one set of preachers of the obvious turns off more ppl than other preachers of the obvious, maybe their ideas aren't actually obvious?
	This is an interesting question but I think @slatestarcodex isn't being parsimonious enough:

	But I'm sure somebody has explained this to him, so it's all good.
	So Trump has found a policy lever that makes ACA's middle-class losers worse off. So the hostages he's taking are ... his party's voters.
	Cutting insurer subsidies means insurers raise prices, subsidies on exchanges rise to match ... and the unsubsidized group gets hosed again.
	The biggest losers under the ACA are middle-class insurance purchasers who don't qualify for subsidies. Also a key GOP constituency.

https://t.co/8btjCId7B3
	Feminism really has helped tame Hefnerism. But back then it hadn't. And the sexualization of teens peaked then, not now.

	58 people murdered by a mass shooter is a horror. But the post-2014 turn in urban murder rates has killed several thousands of people.
	This trend in Baltimore, for instance, is not a gun-control crisis. It's a policing/race/urban policy crisis:
https://t.co/d87gJknoj3
	And our big 1990s gains against violence probably were affected *much* more by policing than by any Clinton-era gun regs.
	Our *actual* recent epidemic of gun violence is happening in cities where police-community relations have collapsed.
	But if you want to reduce gun violence sharply you should be engaged in debates over policing strategy and numbers, first and foremost.

	@smithpatrick08 The attempts to forge alternatives have not been encouraging.
	@MTMehan "Everyone" would not have, because clearly a large share of the establishment preferred Trump to Cruz.
	@meusabsconditus It is striking how Reno and some of his most vocal critics have talked themselves into Trumpism from different directions.
	cc: @kausmickey, et. al.
	And you want the guy who's always thinking about his positioning and base, not the guy relying on wild promises and a cult of personality.
	Normal politicians try to keep their promises. Cruz would have known that support for him was premised on his positioning.
	Not because he was a heart-of-hearts hawk, but because his commitment to their cause was likely sufficient to bind him to it.
	Immigration restrictionists had every reason to fight Jeb and Marco and Kasich, but they clearly should have supported Ted Cruz.
	15. That's all for now.
	14. And if it is post-liberal to recognize distinctive dangers in capitalism, then Catholicism will be post-liberal eventually, or perish.
	13. If you insist that small-l liberalism requires the precise policies of 1980, you will make post-liberalism that much more attractive.
	12. But arguing that any post-Reagan adaptation to new socioeconomic trends is "post-liberal" risks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecies.
	11. Catholics committed to the liberal order have every reason to push back against flirtations with post-liberalism in Reno's essay + mag.
	10. Or that joined noted non-Marxists like Hayek in making peace with universal health coverage. Or that backed pro-natalist policies. Etc.
	9. There would be nothing "post-liberal" about a conservatism that focused less zealously on upper-bracket tax cuts, say.
	8. This doesn't point inexorably toward post-liberalism. Liberty is compatible w/a mixed economy. Different moments require a different mix.
	7. With more of a Chestertonian and two-cheers-for-capitalism conservative spirit than was present in Michael Novak's manifesto.
	6. Rather he's making an argument that if our present liberal order is to be renewed, the times demand a less libertarian conservatism.
	5. I'm a bit of a fence-sitter in that debate. But I think it's a mistake to read Reno's essay as a brief for post-liberalism/integralism.
	4. I've written a fair amount about post-liberal currents in RC thought, and those are, indeed, showing up in FT.

	9. "Yep, this is exactly how the books are going to go. Just stick with what I've been planning, and you'll be just fine. I swear."
	8. "Here's an outline of Tyrion's transformation from the master-strategist who saved King's Landing into the George McClellan of Westeros."
	7. "Here are my detailed notes on the seventeen non-deaths of Jon Snow, the totally ridiculous plan to capture a zombie, and more."
	6. "Trust me, you'll love the mission north of the Wall. It'll blow out your special-effects budget. Ratings gold."
	5. "Keeping them alive will require one deus ex machina after another. It'll make for great television, I promise."
	4. "I'm going to have all my characters start behaving like total morons in the final books. Their plans will get dumber and dumber."
	3. Maybe you decide to sabotage them. Feed them the outline of the rest of the story. "It's all here, you guys. This is what I'm planning."

	@JZmirak @ccpecknold @jneeley78 The real issue is that there are a lot of real issues.
	@JZmirak @ccpecknold @jneeley78 If a statue were put up explicitly to honor a pope *for* supporting a grave evil, I would be open to it.
	@JZmirak @ccpecknold @jneeley78 And yet the U.S. somehow elected a birther as its president.
	@JZmirak @ccpecknold @jneeley78 Racism is one of the most powerful instincts human beings have. Always alive and dangerous.

	@ccpecknold @JZmirak @jneeley78 The leave them up attitude sometimes seems to assume that racism is as dead as Nero.
	@jneeley78 @JZmirak @ccpecknold A statue of Diocletian put up by Julian to celebrate the persecution of Christians might be an analogue.
	@jneeley78 @JZmirak @ccpecknold Not "any" statue, no. Statues that honor ppl precisely *for* their defense of an evil.

	Here's what the earth where Trump fails on policy and goes identitarian to hold his base looks like:
https://t.co/pf7NiDT2S1
	... while the left is trying to take down Confederate statues, that would be advantage Trump. But that's Earth-17, not this one.
	If Trump were out doing big-infrastructure-bill photo ops, or in Rose Garden signing an Ivanka-Rubio tax plan w/multiethnic families ...
	I think that's true. But this administration's "economic nationalism" is mostly stillborn, and Bannon's China fixation ain't enough.
	Bannon to Kuttner: "If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.”
	Bannon can't get Trump, let alone GOP, to go all-in for any of his economic-populist ideas. But he can always get Trump to fight on race.

	@jennyschuessler Looking at this much-shared chart a *lot* went up at the 50th anniversary of the war; those, yes:
https://t.co/pO7iaSwZry
	12. But keep statues of ordinary soldiers, bc God gave "both North + South this terrible war as the woe due those by whom the offense came."
	11. That still seems like a reasonable approach. The statues of CSA leaders should be in museums. Plaques celebrating the Cause should go.
	10. But I also suspect that he would have expected, and welcomed, statues of southern soldiers on battlefields and town greens.
	9. I'm sure Lincoln would have been appalled by the statues that went up as monuments to that cause, to Redemption, Jim Crow, etc.
	8. ... and it points to a way of remembering southern military valor as part of *our* story while rejecting their political cause as wicked.
	7. This is mythmaking, of course, but also not without truth: South didn't invent slavery, Founders accepted it, North tolerated it, etc ...
	6. ... as an (incomplete) expiation in which white Americans know that depending on their birthplace they might have fought on either side.
	5. Lincoln is hinting, I think, at a way that many non-Confederate-nostalgist Civil War buffs think about the war today ...
	4. This is very different from Lost Cause mythos. But it points to a way of remembering Civil War that isn't just CSA=proto-Nazi traitors.
	3. It includes particular and sharp criticisms of the South, but they're joined to an assumption that war is God's judgment on all the USA.
	2. Lincoln's address is a remarkable exercise in attempting national reconciliation by assuming a collective American guilt for slavery.

	And generally, as both reactionaries and the left point out, expanding liberties at the expense of an Other is a very *liberal* thing to do.
	There's overlap with fascism, but a very different theory of society + the state. Pro-slavery republicanism is not a contradiction in terms.
	The idea that liberty and equality of citizens depends on a helot class is much older than America. Ancient republics were slave societies.
	Rather than being fascists Confederates mostly belonged to the tradition that saw slavery and liberty as linked.

	@meusabsconditus Sadly major parts of the Religious Right didn't seem too worried about that little problem.
	From whom, one can only hope, tomorrow's emperors and empresses will learn what not to do.
	But not until he has to. Which is why he will never be anything but a bad ruler, a one-man clinic in how not to preside over diversity.
	If the driver turns out to be definitively white-racist, I bet by tomorrow he gets pressured into it. As with, "I disavow, I disavow."
	But Trump doesn't want to. He sees his own coalition. They're part of it. Therefore, doesn't want to single them out.
	Condemning neo-Confederates and neo-Nazis is the easiest, *easiest* thing a white-conservative emperor can do for inclusion's sake.
	Trump doesn't even bother trying. His (minority) coalition is the only one that exists for him. Can't move to reassure anyone else, ever.
	Bush did this well w/Muslims right after 9/11. Failed w/Katrina. Obama did it well in '08; failed w/rural whites + evangelicals thereafter.
	In ruling a diverse society, the good emperor thinks, "how do I make sure people outside my coalition feel included/respected/safe?"
	Trump's response to Charlottesville is a kind of paradigm for what a bad emperor does in a moment like this.

	13. Only if you assume medical science has advanced so far that when it tells you it doesn't have the answers, none exist.
	12. Or to take a non-religious example: Americans like to experiment with alternative medicine and fad diets. A lot. Is this "irrational"?
	11. Near-death experiences are commonplace. They touch on the central questions of our existence. Why *wouldn't* you study them?
	10. And his terms are dumb! He sneers, in passing, at the attempted scientific study of near-death experiences. Why?
	9. I could multiply examples. America's (heretofore) distinctive religiosity hasn't made us distinctively "irrational," in his terms.

https://t.co/pksXpI6RLl
	6. He presents no evidence for this. Because there isn't much. For instance, he mentions vaccine skepticism as a case study.
	5. But did the *beliefs* that Anderson deems irrational become more common? And is this "irrationalism" distinctively American?
	4. America, including American religion, became more subjectivist, more individualist. Institutions became weaker. Trust declined.
	3. There is a germ of a true idea here. The '60s (which were really the '70s) did change America. Religion had something to do with it.
	@bdomenech (Gouges out eyeballs.)

	11. Those things I hope the new owners will preserve. David Bradley did. Ad multos annos to the magazine he stewarded.
	10. And the magazine today is still serious, still important, still publishes great writers, and remains liberal but also ecumenical.
	9. Things were lost along the way, from the old pre-internet Atlantic I loved. But those losses were common to journalism generally.
	8. He sustained it as a mass-market periodical, not just a niche magazine, and he found a team to put it on firm financial footing.
	7. But in hindsight, with lots of other publications' trajectories to compare with, no mogul did better by their magazine than David.
	6. Working for a rich patron is quite strange, feeds a lot of quite understandable resentments. Also a certainty that you could do better.
	5. Most of us who worked for him assumed that he would, eventually. He lost extremely large sums of money every year I worked there.
	4. The Atlantic wasn't profitable pre-internet. David seemed certain to follow the @jackshafer mogul life cycle:
https://t.co/V2uN2wtjRb
	3. I worked there, before and after the Atlantic moved from Boston to D.C., from 2002 to 2009, as the internet began ravaging journalism.

	It's no individual senator's fault the GOP can't do HC policy. But it is each individual senator's responsibility to do better than this.
	Esp. for the Sasses and McCains and others who talk about fixing the Senate, fixing the republic, etc. Give me a break.
	But to vote "yes" under these circumstances - dead of night vote for a bill with no scrutiny that nobody wants - is just disgraceful.
	I think I may be more sympathetic to the skinny bill than any senator actually voting for it.
	Of course the two are linked: The institutional party's ideological trainwreck created the opening for Trump's chaos populism.

	@jbarro Seems like the stabilization fund in particular would be a useful fattening of the skinny bill.
	Which is not to say that's why the Senate GOP is considering it. Just that it would be coherent if it were all they actually did.
	Again: They would be helped more, and others hurt less, w/more $$. But the mandate repeal alone does pursue a coherent goal.
	But getting rid of the mandate deals w/the major constitutional objection to Obamacare and helps people who lost out most from its design.
	As always w/Republican plans, the skinny bill would make more sense with more $$ for subsidies or auto-enrollment or something else.
	... and lessens burden on middle class ppl in individual market who right now have to choose btw plans that exceed their budget and a fine.
	Repealing individual mandate accomplishes two goals: It gets rid of a feature of the law most conservatives consider unconstitutional ...

	There's also a conservative legal case that a skinny bill puts us where the Roberts Court *should* have left us, but didn't.
	Given disputes about effects of losing the mandate, there's an incrementalist case for doing just and then legislating further in response.

	9. They're closer than eight years ago. But Vance is right: Not close enough.
	8. Any "free-market" plan for HC only works if you subsidize the working class sufficiently to let them *join* the market. Rs aren't there.
	7. You have to subsidize based on inflation that's been baked in over years. And that's what Republicans can't quite bring themselves to do.
	6. So saying "we should imitate Singapore" is fine (I think we should) but you can't then subsidize ppl *as though we lived in Singapore.*
	5. ... you still have to reckon with the fact that that damage has been done, that cost inflation has happened, it's a fact of US life.

	So both moralizing anti-GoT Twitter and moralizing anti-anti-GOT Twitter, read the qualifier!
	Also @mattzollerseitz requests I note he qualifies his point by saying maybe they were trying to be true to (bad) fandom, not GRRM himself.
	@mattzollerseitz I still think you give them way too much credit for the shift. They were feeding babies to dogs five episodes ago!!!
	@mattzollerseitz Would you like a new tweet tagging you that quotes the qualifier, or one at the end of the thread?
	@mattzollerseitz You mean the "fans perception" qualifier? I'll put it in the thread, sorry.
	@AlyssaRosenberg Well -- it exchanges that detail for the invented murder-abortion stabbing!
	(Also once they left the books behind they immediately burned a girl alive and fed a baby and his mother to dogs, so, um ...)
	... because winter is here and too much sexposition would just seem ridiculous at this point.
	Seems much more likely that they were trying to "stay true" to pay-cable pressure to titillate, and that the torture-porn has diminished ...
	Again and again the show upped the ante relative to the books, showing what was implied, adding horrors/porn to what was written.

	Free trade, open borders, welfare-state incrementalism + fiscal responsibility, humanitarian intervention, arc-of-history social liberalism.

	@herandrews One problem is that Trump aligned conservative writers against each other on non-ideological, characterological issues.
	One key to understanding Trump, always, is that he appeals to people by attacking the decadence that he himself also embodies.
	Benedict XVI was one major pre-Trump figure wrestling with these issues. Maybe he should have stuck around for the Trump era ...
	And then when they do, the center-left screams "alt-right" and "white nationalism," and the truth of things slips further out of reach.
	And to paraphrase Frum's line on immigration, if mainstream thinkers/politicians won't do it, you're letting Trumpish demagogues rush in.
	Impossible to fully understand the current unsettlements without digging into moral/familial/spiritual terrain.
	Many issues raised by mass immigration are inseparable from low native fertility. Mass secularism is one of W. Europe's great distinctives.
	But it doesn't go quite deep enough. No mention of religion/secularism, no mention (though hints in work/gender talk) of vanishing babies.

	@EsotericCD An identification that Trump's actual dog whistles to racists has made seem much more plausible.

https://t.co/rxkyXU4DyK
	But it's not white nationalism. It's just ... not. It's a shift responsive to Bush and Obama-era dashings of universal-civilization hopes.
	It's fine to find that air of besiegement to be overdrawn (if a little weird coming from liberals freaking out about Russian power).
	... and naturally informs his rhetoric, which falls back toward more Cold War era vision of the West as bastion rather than universal order.
	World looks more Huntingtonian, less Fukuyaman. That sense of things shifting away from a march of liberalism helped get Trump elected ...
	That universalist view seems a lot less convincing post-Iraq, post-Arab "Spring," w/China's illiberalism resilient and spreading, etc.

	Probably wouldn't have worked. (Harder to do w/the House.) Still it's the play his campaign pointed toward. But no more, too late, farewell.
	The goal would have been to start with the distinctive Trump demographic and build a new political center around it.
	Also Portman, Cotton, others. They would have been in charge of fleshing out an agenda. He would have promised to support it.
	Trump would have come in and tried to organize a Senate "Trump Caucus" -- Capito, Collins, Heller, Cassidy + Manchin, Heitkamp, Donnelly.
	In the politically successful version of the Trump presidency, the moderate Rs holding up the health care bill would have been writing it.
	And they tend less toward the adult, I thought, in the final analysis, than it sometimes seemed along the way:
https://t.co/HJkoZjTntf
	And my "childish" line was a provocation. I like the books and defend them against snobbery. But they're still children's books, w/flaws.
	I think Alan's reading stands as well. But it can't rule out the political reading; it can only complement it and compete with it.
	The books need not be an allegory for our politics, but they *are* political. So they'll be read that way. (Which Rowling seems to like.)
	And my point was just that the Potterverse offers the ambition and idealism of political engagement - without the burdens of ruling Muggles.

https://t.co/Z5UFT78cHm
	And a rain check for the limited-governmenteers. Maybe a lasting Trump-GOP majority will cash it. But right now it's quite unreal.
	I mean, they could happen. But promising cuts in the 2020s basically screams: "THIS IS A BUDGETARY GIMMICK."
	Indeed, I hesitated a little over criticizing the bill's Medicaid cuts, because in a sense they aren't callous but just cynically unreal.
	Meaning it will have a dire CBO score for them to hammer now, but if it passes they will have *forever* to forestall that scenario.
	One thought that didn't make it in: This bill hits a kind of sweet spot, policy and politics-wise, for the Democrats.

	"And that idea that you think is stale, if it's a *good* idea, might always be fresh to someone. So don't be ashamed of returning to it."
	"So if you're afraid of repeating yourself -- well, you will. But many of your readers are only reading, say, one column in five."

	Wouldn't know exactly what to do with the Coens or Wes Anderson. I really like "Moonrise Kingdom" as a dark-horse for the latter.
	Other contenders for my list: "Moulin Rouge," "Squid + the Whale," "25th Hr," "Pan's Labyrinth," "Ida," "Of Gods + Men," "Lives of Others."
	Also, no Malick? I would pick "The New World," but you can't go wrong with "Tree of Life." Yes he has been worse since.
	And "Hail, Caesar!" as well as "No Country" and "A Serious Man" was better than "Llewyn Davis."
	I see too few foreign films so I can't judge all those choices but I did think "Summer Hours" was overpraised.
	Two I'm sure I don't: Million Dollar Baby, Munich.

	But it just can't be the Flight 93 election every minute of every day of every year of his presidential term.
	And you can say it while continuing to believe that NeverTrumpers were wrong in the Hillary-Trump binary. By all means.
	You can even say, "I voted Trump hoping that he'd be constrained, and now I support constraining him." That would be consistent and serious.
	My view is that post-Gorsuch, the reluctantly pro-Trump right should be like a gambler who won big. It's okay to walk away from the table.
	Now we're just being asked to pretend that Trump is a good president when he's obviously an incompetent one. No thanks.
	The pro-Trump side had a clear case for holding your nose and voting Trump. Misguided, but clear. But it doesn't apply anymore.
	So what are we being accused of enabling by our criticism of Trump? What precipice will we go over if we fail to hail his every move?
	But now a Hillary presidency is off the table. Neil Gorsuch is on the Supreme Court. The next election is a loooong way away.
	During the campaign pro-Trumpers insisted that never-Trumpers were acquiescent to a Hillary presidency. In a sense, we were.

	So he's demonstrating that you can slow border crossings, but he's very unlikely to build a permanent architecture of restrictionist reform.

	And requires a serious response in any attempted sketch of what the world (or worlds, multiversers) is and what it means.
	True for me, to some extent -- I'm no mystic, but I've seen firsthand what religious experience looks like. It's a serious thing.
	And the philosophical and metaphysical arguments are often ways that people seek to make their lived experiences make logical sense.
	Meanwhile anecdotal religious experience is obviously not a philosophical proof but it's one of THE reasons for religion's resilience.
	Both are perfectly plausible in their way but neither ultimately offers an escape from metaphysical issues.
	C.S. Lewis's Narnia books take place in a multiverse. Gnostic theology is basically a version of the simulation argument.
	@JonCoppage It's the most important reason for the persistence of religious belief, at the very least.
	Also it's not that believers find multiverse or simulation arguments "absurd" but rather that they just kick the problem up a level.
	Among the options, the argument from supernatural/numinous/mystical experience is underrated in my opinion.

	Elected representatives govern the country. The mechanism I proposed for removing Trump requires 2/3 support from those representatives.
	What 49 percent of the country or 57 percent of the country or whatever thinks about an issue at any given time does not govern the country.

	Which is not ideal, but I'm okay with it, because I'm a conservative who doesn't think pure democracy is any way to run a country.

	@jpodhoretz https://t.co/LJwROk0ovU
	26. /Finis. Thanks for listening.
	25. So perhaps elites should act like elites, and then set about rectifying through appropriate policy means the failures that led to Trump.
	24. And all the calculation about "what Trump voters will think of us" has only brought us to this ridiculous place.
	23. If this is the case, acting in accordance with their constitutional obligations seems like it might be ... the right thing to do.
	22. My argument is that their quotes are telling us every day, in every way, that they basically think he can't.
	21. Only ppl closest to Trump - not Congress but his Cabinet - can really judge his capacity "to discharge powers + duties of his office."
	20. But it harnesses a central *use* of an elite - their ability to respond swiftly to a situation the public as a whole can't reckon with.
	19. This is also, of course, a reason why it's less likely to happen than impeachment. It really is an extraordinary step.
	18. And the 25th arguably requires more consensus across parties and branches of govt than does impeachment.
	17. But it is also possible that a president can be too dangerous to keep in office without having committed clear "high crimes."
	16. Cooke argues that impeachment is still the better way, that it would feel less like its own kind of coup. Again, he may be right.
	15. So the refusal to do anything too abnormal against Trump greases the skids toward ever-more-abnormal territory.
	14. Even absent actual war, Noah Millman's point is important: This is a recipe for a soft military-civilian crisis:

	10. ... does not correct the elite's earlier errors; it compounds them. And it is more likely to postpone a reckoning than to avoid one.
	9. But to respond to that failure by abdicating in a case where the elite is right and the vox populi (or 25% thereof) is wrong ...
	8. Our elite has misgoverned, it has been unwise, it has failed ppl in ways that make them mistrust elite wisdom. Hence DJT's appeal.
	7. But what, in the end, are elites for? What justifies their existence? Some sort of wisdom that the vox populi can lack.
	6. This was often cast not as timidity but as strategy: Bc DJT's base hated elites, the elite turning on him would only make him stronger.
	5. Folks like Romney and GWB made clear they weren't voting for him, but they weren't going to do anything wild like endorsing someone else.
	4. Hillary Clinton's campaign theme was "Trump's an existential threat, but I'm not going to tack to the center or anything to stop him."
	3. A Cruz-Rubio unity ticket? Too wild. Paul Ryan leading opposition to him at the convention? Too party-fracturing.
	2. A recurring Trump-era theme is ppl saying "Trump is an unprecedented disaster, but we can't try anything too unprecedented to stop him."

	The toothless executive order and the design of the AHCA whack at #2 and #3 pretty hard.
	Three plausible Catholic arguments for Trump: Solid on judges, solid on religious liberty, more populist and worker-friendly than GOP norm.
	This was not a particularly good day for the Catholic case for Trump.

	10. Put another way: Until I convince @NickKristof or @DLeonhardt to go social-conservative, I won't have helped to save America.
	9. ... conservative representation in "neutral" institutions will be praiseworthy but not transformative or de-polarizing, I expect.
	8. ... but the right doesn't seem to be in any kind of shape to encourage/attract/welcome converts. Until it is, though ...
	7. I don't know if such a moment can come round again. Probably not in the age of Trump: Left-wing excess might push liberals away ...
	6. But it didn't last, thanks in no small part to the Bush-era mistakes of conservatives (neo and otherwise) themselves.
	5. The last time such conversions seemed plausible was just after 9/11 -- a neoconservative moment if there ever was one.
	4. Conservatism did that, to some extend, from the 1970s onward: That's what neoconservatism in its various forms represented.
	3. ... in the end the way "neutral" institutions become *legitimately* more neutral is if conservatism wins actual converts within them.
	2. I'm obviously (self-interestedly?) in favor of liberal gatekeepers at "neutral" institutions embracing ideological diversity. But ...

	@mattyglesias @MattBruenig This is the secret teaching of Thomas Piketty.
	Idea of an American theocracy is, yes, a fever dream. But Atwood works harder to make it plausible than is sometimes acknowledged. /finis
	... to the brink of self-destruction and a theocratic backlash was the result. Which strikes me as a more interesting idea to contemplate.
	She doesn't just say, "oh, Christian men hated modernity and set out to destroy it." She implies that modernity brought society ...
	This doesn't vindicate Atwood's view of the Christian right. But her imagination is more subtle than just "Falwell today, Gilead tomorrow."
	This is why it's an interesting companion novel to "Children of Men"; their dystopias are different but have a common root.
	... it envisions it being imposed amid catastrophe, when sexual + industrial revolutions seem like they're destroying human reproduction.
	So the novel doesn't envision Gilead just evolving naturally from Falwell-ism, one step at a time ...
	And it's explicitly linked to both pollution and STDs (remember Atwood was writing during the AIDS epidemic).
	It's not as total as the male infertility in "Children of Men," but it seems to be something like 80 percent infertility.
	The details are left sketchy, but it's the reason for the central conceit, the office of the handmaid: Most women can't have babies anymore.
	But it's not quite right to say Atwood's story just tries to extrapolate from existing trends. She also has a real catastrophe intervene.
	I agree, of course, w/many of the points Megan makes about the implausibility of theocratic totalitarianism establishing itself in the US.

	@lymanstoneky The UMC is probably the closest to Catholicism in terms of containing multitudes/contradictions.
	@lymanstoneky One takeaway is that journalists should write more about the Methodists.
	Macron just has the air of a man fated to preside over a debacle.
	My official take (comment dit-on "take" en francais?) is that electing Macron is a bad idea, so that's what I'm also rooting for.
	But if you're looking for a larger terror-induced swing, a last-minute shift of lukewarm Macron voters back to Fillon seems plausible.
	Le Pen's support has slipped, so she has room to grow -- she could win a few more working class votes from Mélenchon, for instance.
	Well, not totally ungrounded: The biggest movements in the race have been Fillon voters going to Macron and Hamon voters going to Mélenchon.
	My totally-ungrounded guess is that the terror attack helps Fillon.

https://t.co/MkBOIi5zb1
	11. Which is, I suppose, a qualification of Damon's point. Definition of UHB here: https://t.co/XZdxt8eaLA  /Finis
	10. ... to both the very distinctive temptations facing politicians and to the ordinary temptations facing ppl who aren't liberal UHBs.
	9.  ... might not work as well as, ahem, a universal approach. And the stricter rules of the Pence approach might be better-suited ...
	8. ... it also may be one of the many cases where what works well for highly-educated ppl trained in impulse control w/much to lose ...
	7. Which is a perfectly sensible way of doing things in many ways. It has fit my own marriage perfectly well (so far). But ...
	6. They have, in a sense, hidden rules that aren't absolute but do bind. And they rely on them as well as Kantian virtue to avoid scandal.
	5. Maybe I knew weird lame liberals but don't think so. I think educated marrieds operationalize modified Pence-ism w/out making explicit.
	4. Or going out to parties and getting tipsy w/out the spouse. Of course it happened but would've been unusual for liberal marrieds I knew.
	3. Having lived among them as a youngish married person, I didn't see an awful lot of married ppl dining out one-on-one w/opposite sex.
	2. I kid. My one thought is this: I think a lot of liberal married UHBs are a little closer to the Pence approach than they might admit.
	1. I have a 72-part tweetstorm planned on this 43-part @DamonLinker tweetstorm:

	@baseballcrank That's a really good point.

	@lymanstoneky Don't sell yourself short.
	@JonCoppage Yeah you need a balance between Cowen and Yglesias I think.

	@jeffspross We definitely do.
	@ebruenig Care to discuss them over dinner?
	@Noahpinion I just mean that people in their 30s know fewer people whose marriages have ended in divorce than people in their 50s.
	@Noahpinion Also I bet you know lots of them.
	@Noahpinion What seems "generational" may reflect greater experience with infidelity and divorce.
	This is why the internet is bad.
	My response to the Pence rule two days ago would've been "I dunno, seems overly strict." After reading its critics I'm basically all for it.
	Reading responses to this Pence thing is a case study in how radicalization works.
	@JayCostTWS That's not really my worst-case scenario.
	@jonathanchait What is brunch?
	@jonathanchait In my own landscape of social/moral intuition, the lunch/dinner division seems important.
	@yeselson @ModeledBehavior But I think lots of ppl would choose more cash income over comprehensiveness if that choice were clear.
	@yeselson @ModeledBehavior My personal experience as a health care consumer these last two years doesn't fit either narrative that well.
	@HeerJeet @JonCoppage @amconmag They aren't actually all that paleo on FP, I think. More just "more rubble, less trouble" hawks.
	@HeerJeet @JonCoppage Maybe Trump can fund one in his post-presidency. I hear he's a billionaire.
	@HeerJeet @JonCoppage American Affairs has funding. They just need a tax and health care plan.
	@HeerJeet @JonCoppage If you could somehow mash up @amconmag, the reformocon wing of AEI and Heritage you'd be close.
	@HeerJeet @JonCoppage Billionaires fund liberal and left-wing causes. Why not right-populist ones?
	... periodic reversions toward Tea Party-ish populism are to be expected, even if they don't make political sense for Trump himself.
	Don't think it can work without shedding all the votes that Trump gained. But folks are going to try, and as Trump himself is a vacuum ...
	*Lots* of Trump fans considered themselves Tea Partiers just a few yrs ago. They have a strong desire to unite the populist streams.
	The whole Bannon "taking on the administrative state" thing being a prime example.
	But right-wing populism is so ideologically inchoate these days that you can see a lot of attempts to make them go together.
	Rich is right that on economic policy esp., Trump-the-candidate and the Freedom Caucus don't have a lot of obvious common ground.
	One though on this @RichLowry column (with which I not surprisingly agree):
https://t.co/OyTvvQ5Q2T
	@SonnyBunch At least it's emphatically NOT decadence.
	@SonnyBunch There's ... https://t.co/zOA7dfmBXD
	@RichLowry @mattyglesias I think so. Trumpian laziness + lack of anyone who thought out policy is a pretty parsimonious explanation.
	Not to go all @SonnyBunch on you but "The Fifth Element" is kind of better than every "Star Wars" movie since "Empire."
	Sweet:
https://t.co/gBVxS6bSdc
	@RichLowry @mattyglesias Presumably Trump can't really go to war w/Ryan et. al. because he needs them not to investigate, censure, impeach.
	Both are dystopias conjured up out of low-fertility anxiety, even if the dystopias themselves are, obviously, quite different.
	Re-reading "The Handmaid's Tale." Rhymes with/echoes of "Children of Men" more striking than I remembered.
	@jeffspross I *don't* think that should cash out in a commitment to the lowest possible marginal tax rates on the rich, though.
	@jeffspross ... and Christians should be wary of becoming creatures/clients of the state, and thus wary of #fullsocialdemocracy.
	@jeffspross For my part I suspect that state programs can't help crowding out/bigfooting church mission to some extent ...
	@jeffspross And part of it is a "God loves capitalism" strain in US Protestantism -- esp. non-denom, entrepreneurial Protestantism.
	@jeffspross Part of it is that Western Europe's combination of full social democracy + secularization looks to ppl like a cautionary tale.
	@jeffspross Part of it is that low-church/dissenting Protestantism in the U.S. has always had a strong anti-central govt bias.
	@jpodhoretz What if you have a grand sociological theory about the reactions to the Pences?
	Curious what the folks horrified by the Pence "no meals alone w/opposite sex" rule would think if it only applied to dinner and drinks.
	@GabrielRossman @rgcooke The work of Messrs. Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock is not exactly barren of crypto-reactionary sentiment.
	@DLeonhardt @mattyglesias 2008-2012 was, as @davidfrum likes to remind us, a pretty ideological time on the right.
	@DLeonhardt @mattyglesias I think like many people his ideological intensity waxes and wanes.
	@DLeonhardt He was a perfectly loyal foot soldier for compassionate conservatism once upon a time.
	@DLeonhardt @mattyglesias Also, Obama was also quite eager to treat Ryan as a foil ...
https://t.co/43LbfQFsf7
	@DLeonhardt @mattyglesias Once O was re-elected and the shutdown weakened the intransigents, he did cut our only recent budget deal.
	@DLeonhardt @mattyglesias 1) Ambition (beat him, don't work with him), 2) nature of his coalition, 3) real ideological difference.
	@mattyglesias @DLeonhardt Working with Alice Rivlin or Ron Wyden or Patty Murray yields different results than working with his own party.
	@mattyglesias @DLeonhardt The quality of Ryan's proposals almost always depend on whom he's tacitly negotiating with.

	@Noahpinion I'll read the book. I'm curious what the tests are.
	@Noahpinion That concept dovetails with my internet skepticism. But it still sort-of feels like a retrofitted explanation.
	@Noahpinion Shouldn't ease/speed of communication enable more companies to base in small cities, more knowledge workers to telecommute, etc?
	@Noahpinion My naive question is, why doesn't information economy enable more decentralization?
	@GabrielRossman I'm still working out the details :)

	@GabrielRossman So you'd have the same # applications to Harvard, but some admittees would be assigned to the Natchez campus.
	@GabrielRossman It's not a rigorous proposal, but goal would be to spread elite U resources/footprint, not decrease demand for them.
	@SonnyBunch The Tulsa Free Beacon will be a great read.
	@SonnyBunch Actually I think the style of the tweet makes clear that he doesn't. "I don't care about this, but you said you did, nyah nyah."
	(To clarify I mean the Milne play.)
	Is it really possible that "Toad of Toad Hall" is out of print?
	Harsh but fair:
https://t.co/veMKFuLwiJ
	@baseballcrank Ah but they read Maurras!
	@mattyglesias Oh the Journal. Never mind.
	@mattyglesias It's true, though, that Freedom Caucus's demands were a big reason (if 1 of many) why it was hard to imagine 50 Senate votes.
	@BillKristol Alternatively he could tweet a lot and Bannon could give some hot quotes about tearing down the administrative state.
	Priebus staffed up w/very conventional Republicans. Better than staffing w/kooks, but so far useless for translating Trumpism into policy.
	Bannon talked during the transition like maybe he did, but no evidence for that; he's too busy planning for the clash of civilizations.
	Trump made a lot of big, heterodox promises on the campaign trail. Now clear nobody in his circle of trust thought about how those cash out.
	Trump's presidency is flailing for many reasons, but lack of close advisers who've thought about translating populism into policy is key.
	@brianbeutler @AlecMacGillis The conservative writers I read were all but uniform in their opposition to the AHCA.
	It won't happen but Cassidy-Collins remains a reasonable idea:
https://t.co/xCBColFimL
	@KSoltisAnderson Get ready.
	... yes, it all makes sense now.
	With his run against Hillary as his Reagan-in-'76, his age as a supposed impediment, his wild-eyed socialism as a supposed liability ...
	So now that everyone seems to be coming around to Trump as Jimmy Carter, it's time to ponder ... Bernie Sanders as Ronald Reagan.
	@IChotiner Which makes him the only major person in Trump's orbit who has claimed to have a fleshed-out vision of what Trump campaigned on.
	@IChotiner Of course. But he's postured as having a vision of how to make the GOP a workers' party.
	@ThePlumLineGS At least that's a policy agenda!
	Bannon is the main ideologist of Trumpism with Trump's ear. Trump needs him to have substantive influence on policy. Not impressed so far.
	Is there a Bannonist alternative to the health care bill implied here, or just a bunch of populist mental gestures?
https://t.co/s4GiuKmamH
	Bannon, unfortunately, so far seems like a walking impulse in search of a substantive agenda.
	@chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump Chris.

	@JonCoppage They'll wear her down on that one.
	@JonCoppage What has she done to the poor dear things now?
	Craven and self-justifying and ridiculous? Sure. But not exactly wrong.
	He's not wrong:
https://t.co/SVmwpnzEuV
	@mckaycoppins Especially when some of the strongest skeptics of the bill are the remains of the Tea Party.
	@mckaycoppins I don't see much evidence that GOP voters are poised to punish Rs for non repeal.
	Nobody likes it for a reason. The status quo is flawed but hardly an emergency. Vote no and do something else instead.
	In theory there's a path from passing a bad bill to having something good emerge from House-Senate negotiations. But I think not in reality.
	Not that they particularly care about my opinion, but my advice to all House Rs is to just vote no.
	@GabrielRossman @WilcoxNMP Some modest acceleration in 2014 it looks like.
	It would be interesting to see this comparison with data for European whites only:
https://t.co/xklyD1D3O3
	@jneeley78 @jbarro Sure? No.
	@ThePlumLineGS @jonathanchait If a bill like this just boiled down to their individual considerations it would never ever pass.
	@jonathanchait @jbarro "The President wants this" is a very powerful argument. When the President obviously doesn't care, it's a weaker one.
	@jonathanchait @jbarro I think that's the wrong way to think about why reps vote for these things.
	@jbarro But now my sense is that having a POTUS this checked out from policy creates an incompetence cascade.
	@jbarro I thought otherwise for a while, bc I thought Trump's wild promises might force a better bill.
	@jbarro AHCA would be better if Jeb or Kasich or Rubio were president. Doesn't mean it would be good, but it wouldn't be this bad.
	@jbarro They thought if it came to it, they would have a president who would impose Capretta.
	To @jbarro here, I think it's almost certainly worse politically for the GOP to pass the AHCA as is than not:

	@mattyglesias @ebruenig There's certainly a case for it.
	@ebruenig The left has been good at mass graves, it's true.
	@ebruenig I'm skeptical liberalism is in *deep* trouble now in part bc both right and left seem to be just exhuming old ideas + thinkers.
	@ebruenig My guess is that it will require events that make our French Revolution categories somewhat obsolete.
	That is -- unwisely.
	The Republicans are basically behaving like you'd expect a party unused to governing and lacking normal presidential leadership to behave.
	Remember when Waxman-Markey passed the House?
	@mattyglesias I don't take parenting advice from countries with a 1.7 TFR.
	@jbarro Yes, the already-baked-in price inflation makes all reforms that much harder.
	For the record, here's my years-old case against Medicaid for all. 
https://t.co/PX8GKesZ26
	... while Trump-friendly non-Republicans (well, okay, just @kausmickey) tout Medicare at 55:
https://t.co/HSHHoXfieM
	Don't expect this to happen under Trump but I think it's telling this his pals are urging Medicaid on him ...
https://t.co/2ycjnykAwQ
	... in which Medicare for 55 happens and Medicaid replaces more and more of the individual market.
	Just to elaborate on the last line: What actually seems most likely is a Medicaid/Medicare pincer ...

	@jimantle He had the luxury of a boom, but "the era of big govt is over" was more about abjuring new programs than attacking old ones.
	@jimantle True, but he never made the Medicare deal, and his '96 campaign was all M2E2.
	And they've ended up equating what might just be 1990s nostalgia with 1950s or even 1870s nostalgia.
	What white working class voters want, maybe, is just (Bill) Clintonism. But liberals have decided Clintonism was immoral.
	With the kicker of this piece being an extreme but by no means unrepresentative example:
https://t.co/U4Sx7ODpQq
	But today's liberals are increasingly anathematizing everything Bill Clinton did on immigration, crime, welfare, abortion, etc.
	The 1990s suggest that what actually defangs white working class nativism is a liberalism more open to some cultural-conservative concerns.
	Was thinking about the 1990s while reading the latest round of liberals debating, "can economic policy defang white working class nativism?"
	This was a good piece:

	@BenjySarlin @IChotiner Including in our politics, now!
	@BenjySarlin @IChotiner The Matrix is just way better than Inception, and way bigger cultural footprint.
	@jamespoulos @petersuderman Yeah, Inception wasn't great.
	@petersuderman @mattyglesias The Incredibles I might buy.
	@mattyglesias I wasn't including official kids movies. Also I'm starting to think the cult of Pixar is a little overblown.
	@IChotiner You're half-right. But DKR &gt; TDK.

	@michaelbd Come now, the Council of Trent clearly taught that grace makes heroic virtue possible for all pundits.
	Am I tradshaming or tradsplaining now? 

Okay, I'll stop. Back to work.
	kidding (not kidding).
	The Catholic world still awaits 10,000 accessible words from @michaelbd on why the Novus Ordo must perish. He's letting his side down.
	... but those arguments seem to be perpetually written for the pre-converted and I'm afraid this wasn't an exception.
	Novus-Ordo conservative Catholics are, I think, more open than ever to the arguments of Tridentine-riters ...
	As long as I'm tweeting about fraught intra-religious-conservative debates, I found this essay disappointing:
https://t.co/IWuD4DdZKp
	@WAWilsonIV True, but Orthodoxy in the West is just not a major stream (as yet).
	@james_ka_smith That's what happens when you court evangelical readers :)
	@WAWilsonIV Well isn't that nice for YOU.
	@james_ka_smith I don't have it in front me; maybe he doesn't. But the book is, um, literally named for Saint Benedict.
	@james_ka_smith Norcia is clearly the book's touchstone. And it's not like he joined a church that's anti-monastic.
	@james_ka_smith My sense is that many readers (including my op-ed colleague) come away thinking, "so many monks!"
	And it wouldn't be the worst thing to say instead: "Dreher implies that before anything, we need *lots* more monks and nuns. He's right."
	... while important in its way (I'm not becoming a monk, my wife wouldn't allow it), might also be a symptom of the spirit of the age.
	And the tendency of so many BenOp readers to say, "well, we need to make sure this is relevant to Xtians living in the 'real world'" ...
	No: We're in a position where consecrated life is more marginal/invisible in the everyday than at any point in Western Xtian history.
	Like, are we ("we" being Christians) really in a position where we're worried that way too many people are considering monastic life?
	Which I don't think (and I don't think @roddreher thinks) is how it should be read. And yet ... would it be the worst thing if it were?
	I'm gently defending the BenOp from critics, and I suggest that it shouldn't be read as an absolutist, "to a monastery, go!" exhortation.
	In my column today, which takes up the great Benedict-Option debate, there is a line I'd like to qualify:
https://t.co/5qrngf1B8r
	@ebruenig But that is different than just saying, pejoratively, "it's a religion!"
	@ebruenig e.g., https://t.co/TCHJbSralZ, or https://t.co/dVWAmNxtOv
	@ebruenig I think recognizing displaced religious energy in "secular" left and right-wing politics is useful.

	@yeselson Does Trump support this health care bill or does he "support" it?
	@yeselson Chris Ruddy urging Trump to embrace Medicaid and Breitbart hammering AHCA for coverage losses is populist, yes.
	@yeselson I'm talking about the health care debate.
	@ThePlumLineGS Everything's relative: The populists are the people who want to keep the Medicaid expansion.
	And the attempts from some Trumpists to square the new populism w/2011-vintage TrueConservatism are just incoherent:
https://t.co/ndaZ9ZiV3A
	Republican divisions are very plainly now populist/libertarian rather than conservative/moderate.
	@allahpundit Yes, though I'm not sure the terms "conservatives" and "moderates" are useful if Breitbart and Newsmax are the moderates.
	@michaelbd I got it too; imagine its connected to the alt-right mass emails I sometimes get.
	Newsmax for Medicaid! Breitbart against coverage cuts! Tucker Carlson dinging Ryan for upper-end tax cuts! Dogs and cats ... well, you know.

	The CBO's view of the individual mandate's impact is no doubt buttressed by impressive models, but I still don't understand it.

https://t.co/hLx7RbWTdl
	If you notice that "replacing Obamacare with something half-baked just so we can say we did it" isn't in there -- well, yeah.
	Said it once, I'll say it again: "Infrastructure. Tax cuts for workers + parents. A better tax code for business." 
https://t.co/KzRpYeJWYZ
	@chrislhayes It seems crazy to think he isn't.
	@MTMehan True but the GOP is not making a particularly strong case that their plan would do right by all.
	Cotton and Cassidy ain't voting for this bill.
	@AnnieLowrey I'm just saying it is not yet clear to me that Donald Trump is working to pass the AHCA.
	@ebruenig The "sheep" in this case being #fullsocialisttheocracy.
	@ebruenig *be* hanged, that is.
	@ebruenig Might as well hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.

Have my disagreements but Jenkins is always interesting.
	@TheStalwart @chrislhayes @ThePlumLineGS @HeerJeet He's obviously not the puppet master. He can't tell Ryan what to do.
	@TheStalwart @chrislhayes @ThePlumLineGS @HeerJeet Has the AHCA passed?
	@TheStalwart @ThePlumLineGS @HeerJeet Oh but Bannon and Ryan have buried the hatchet, haven't you heard? All sweetness and light.
	@ThePlumLineGS @HeerJeet ... recall earlier reports that Bannon + Kushner were internal skeptics of repeal push.
	@HeerJeet Oh I don't have any "facts." But they're obsolete.
	@ThePlumLineGS @HeerJeet I mean, maybe Breitbart has an independent editorial line and he's furious at their coverage, but ...
	@HeerJeet Nothing is obsolete than can be repurposed.

On a related note Bannon's fingerprints are all over ACA repeal-skepticism right now.
	@HeerJeet No, but it's more than that; there's a reason conservatives like Lasch more than other left-populist authors.
	@HeerJeet What's the difference between "suspiciously rootless luftmenschen" and traitors to the localist democratic spirit? Not a vast one.
