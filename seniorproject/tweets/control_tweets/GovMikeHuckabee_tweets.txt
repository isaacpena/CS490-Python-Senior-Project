	ESPN will not use Dolly Parton songs as bumpers--might remind people of Dolly Madison, wife of slave-owner President James Madison.

	Ignorance of history of 17th Amendment is revealed by response to my earlier Tweet.  Direct election of Senate is major cause of #swamp.

	Maybe it's Congress that needs to be repealed and replaced!  Elect a Congress that wants to work with @POTUS instead of filling the swamp.
	100 yrs ago was Bolshevik Revolution-after seeing opulence of Czars I understand why. Can DC learn from history or destined to repeat it?
	If GOP Senators Murkowski, Collins, and Capito won't stop Planned Parenthood $$ to vacuum babies from womb, then vacuum them out of office!
	Congress has failed @POTUS but more importantly failed the American public by spending 7 years condemning ACA and then having NOTHING.
	Now that Senate fails on bill let's hope they do simple repeal and turn $$ and plans over to states. Repeal and Refer.

	Baby-steps to "Repair" Obamacare?  NO!  REPEAL and REPLACE with bold approach: "REPEAL and REFER" to states and free market solutions.
	Congress fixing Obamacare is like having 535 wannabe chefs take their spoons and spices to the kitchen and "fixing" the pot on the stove.
	Why does DC think THEY should REPLACE?  Just REPEAL!  Let states and the free market do the replacing! DC can't create a 50 state solution.
	Focus on PREVENTION and CURES-not expensive INTERVENTION. Chronic disease is 80% of health costs-tackle THAT,not just "access" to insurance.
	Fed healthcare plan is NO plan; Accept 10th amendment and let states create plans that include compacts allowing multi-state groups, plans.
	Repeal Obamacare with 1 yr total phaseout; block grant ALL fed funds now in control of feds to states; let states craft plan for each state.

	Whether by Russians or left-wing radicals, trying to oust a duly ELECTED gov't and smear @POTUS is threat to country and Constitution.
	To be clear-Libs fear Russia disrupted our election process so they respond by trying to disrupt our election process b/c they hate results.
	It's not RUSSIANS we should worry about attempting to hack elections-it's RADICALS who assassinate and try to overthrow elected officials

	Still ZERO evidence that @POTUS had 1 THING to do w/ Russia. Are Dems/MSM ready to try something else-Impeach him for 2 scoops of ice cream?
	Dems act like they never heard of atty/client privilege; AG is top atty in Exec branch; serves @POTUS and not stooge of Congress.
	Comey uncomfortable w/ @POTUS and queasy w/ L Lynch and said some things made him nauseous; Simple solution!  Tums!
	Has Mark Warner read the Constitution and understand separation of powers?  Sessions taking him to school--in this case, kindergarten.
	Some of the Senators in front of AG Sessions are asking for soft cushions cause they just got their butts kicked by Jeff Sessions. #butthurt
	Jeff Sessions about to give this committee a taste of hard core covfefe!  Take the young children out of the room!
	Enemies of @realDonaldTrump (media, Dems, elites) aren't afraid he will FAIL-they are terrified he will SUCCEED and truly change things.
	Dennis Rodman going to North Korea; will return riding on a missile like Slim Pickens rode the bomb in Dr. Strangelove.  Yeehaw!
	I'll be on w/ @seanhannity tonight on @FoxNews at 10pm ET. If you don't watch, Jim Comey will leak your grocery list to the NY Times!
	About to be on @FoxBusiness at 5pm ET; will explain how my 3 yr old grandson's emoji tweet was Comey's leaked memo to NY Times.
	Glad that @BankofAmerica and @AmericanExpress joined @Delta in pulling funding for disgusting play glorifying assassination of @POTUS; THNX!
	Come on @AmericanExpress--you would NOT have sponsored a "play" about assassination of Pres Obama so give customers a reason to trust U!
	Kudos to @Delta for pulling $$ from "play" portraying assassination of @POTUS. No one should sponsor crap like that! https://t.co/J2SeusqKyz
	Comeys notes were govt property;he took them &amp; leaked to unauthorized source after folding to L Lynch political pressure. Stellar job Jim!
	In Dallas to speak for Friends of Zion banquet. Will reveal meaning of covfefe and distribute full text of Comey's leaked memos. Big deal!
	With MO Gov @EricGreitens today; he's calling special session Monday to pass bold protections for unborn children and women-strong leader!
	Thrilled to be with Gov @EricGreitens tomorrow in SW MO to assist his courageous fight for sanctity of life in the Show-Me State. Hope 2-C-U
	I'm ok now, but needed CPR today when Comey said wasn't sure if FBI agent legally required to report a crime he saw. Seriously?
	7 words Loretta Lynch hopes she doesn't hear today after Comey testimony:  "You have the right to remain silent."
	Comey wasted his talent at FBI; he testified he knew in detail what AG Sessions was thinking from body language. He's a dang clairvoyant!
	Will fmr AG Lynch be charged w/ obstruction of justice after Comey revelations of demands she made? Will Dems demand it?
	We learned: Comey leaked stuff to press;he was too weak to stand up to @POTUS and rolled over from pressure from AG Lynch; yes he got fired!
	Dems are playing air guitar and pretending they are at Woodstock; Comey has mostly revealed HIS weakness rather than @POTUS failure.
	Before Comey's hearing read this WSJ analysis of Comey’s statement-it proves that @POTUS was right to fire him.

	On @FoxNews at 730et to explain how old white men kept ME from being President. Oh crud! I AM an old white man! Calling Lisa Bloom!
	Note to Kathy Griffin: it wasn't "old white men" that ruined your career. It was ONE OLD WHITE WOMAN. Look in the mirror to see who she is.
	Sad to hear that @JennaLeeUSA is leaving Fox.A classy young lady, total pro as journalist, and genuinely nice person. Heartfelt best wishes.
	5pm ET @FoxBusiness I will explain things to you.  I can only explain it to you; if you're a leftist, I can't understand it for you.
	Kathy Griffin says SHE was bullied by Trump family after disgusting photo of Trump's severed head. That's 1st funny thing she's said in yrs!
	My thoughts about @realdonaldtrump decision to withdraw from the #Paris deal: https://t.co/cY2C0PnQNC https://t.co/T6K59r4MMD
	Talk about global warming? I'll be blowing REAL hot air on Fox this morning at 10:30ET with Bill Hemmer! Watch and get a face full of CO2.
	Wetlands are protected! Between leftists flooding planet with tears and wetting themselves over anything @realDonaldTrump does, we'll be ok.
	I'm on @seanhannity tonight 10pm ET. @realDonaldTrump canceled a phone call with Vladimir Putin just so HE could watch. Shouldn't YOU watch?
	Glad @POTUS said NO to Paris and YES to American jobs;all for conservation for but not capitulation to globalists.
	Today @POTUS is 1 for 2 on campaign promises;YES on pulling out of Paris;NO on moving US Embassy to Jerusalem, legitimate capital of Israel.
	If Obama thought Paris Accords were so wonderful, why didn't he take it to Senate instead of doing his end-around Congress?
	Kathy Griffin Goes Too Far: My thoughts:  https://t.co/eL8DGoJI04 https://t.co/dC5hsRoEET
	Concerned about damage to his image, Satan distances himself from Kathy Griffin.

	@kathygriffin does impossible-brings Dems and GOP together in universal outrage over shocking, disgusting,hateful photo;even CNN appalled.

	Lady at Tel Aviv airpt came up and ran her fingers through my hair;not to worry, Janet--wasn't seductive-just checking for lice. #norespect

	On way to Chicago for speech. Expecting to have to run from plane dodging bullets like Hillary did in Bosnia when under sniper fire! Yikes!
	G Kessler at WAPO tweeted that newsroom cheered at rpt of fake story that @realDonaldTrump leaked top secret info to Russians. Objectivity?
	Washington ComPost runs fake news story of @realDonaldTrump and Russians;Everyone there says it's lie; it's why ppl hate and distrust media.

	My friend @RichardGrenell needs to have key role in State Dept. He knows that DC isn't only swamp.  They are all over the world.

	Anderson Cooper:see eye DR immediately! Ur eyes rolling back during intvu of WH official-no REAL journalist would roll eyes; much be medical
	CNN now stands for Cardiac Care Network because their ppl are having heart attacks over Trump doing what Dems once demanded-fire Comey.
	Media is melting down like a snowball in hell-are these the same media folks who called for Comey's head when they thought he hurt Hillary?
	POTUS TO COMEY: "You're fired". Comey went from cleaning up his testimony to cleaning out his desk. Whew, busy day!
	As I predicted-liberals who hated Comey now crying more about firing than southerners did when Elvis died-they hate DT more than love Comey
	@realDonaldTrump actually said to Comey "Don't let the door hit you where the Good Lord split you!"  Or something like that.
	Comey's fired, which means Trump must be one of the few people in DC that the FBI doesn't have something on.
	Watch liberals who scalded Comey now try to pretend they support him and attack @realDonaldTrump. He needed to go.
	Will Hillary praise firing of Comey since she blames him for her defeat? He had lost confidence of rank and file FBI.

	Why not focus on cures? Money is in treatment so change the model! Give large prizes for cures to incentivize cure. Save lives and suffering
	Road test health plans in select states before imposing on all 50. Any plan needs clinical trials not assumptions.
	Both parties say they can offer more health care for less $ but that's ballon juice. Decide if important as roads or water and pay for it.

	Oscar Mayer rolls out new weenie-all pork called the GOP. Artificial taste and ingredients. Lose weight--Makes you sick if you eat it.

	@realDonaldTrump takes Russia to task for Syrian complicity-will the left and MSM I repeat myself) let go of the Russian accusations crap?

	Shia LaBeouf movie sells total of 3 tickets in UK; real blockbuster; his next film will be iPhone video that he shares at Waffle House booth
	On forcing nuclear option: Dems will get what they want, but they won't want what they get. Schumer's legacy and America's loss.

	My previous tweet? April Fool's! I'm not deleting-I think alt-left loons should. Or at least follow someone who cares. I sure don't!
	I'm sick of being ridiculed by hateful and intolerant mean alt left loons. I'm deleting my Twitter account because I can't take it anymore.
	Forget what the Russians were doing-what were AMERICAN spooks doing spying on US citizens and spreading it around Obama team.  #felony
	Tomorrow is April Fool's Day, or in the case of the media, just another day of making crap up and hoping people will buy it.

	Turn details over to states.  Each state is different; different needs, demographics, and access.  A 50 state solution is 50 state failure.
	Prevention is better than intervention; treating disease after it hits is unsustainable; spend the money on CURING the most costly diseases.
	Take on 4 big diseases that cost the BULK of $$: Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimers, diabetes; find CURES like we did with polio in 50's.
	Special pool for expensive chronic care patients; put them in regular pool and costs are unaffordable--a fault of Obamacare.
	Give options for coverage needed-not a gov't choice, but patient choice; transparency in system crucial. 3rd party payer is bad idea.
	Let states impose small affordable co-pays, deductibles, and premiums in Medicaid. Controls utilization but doesn't deny needed coverage.
	Medicaid needs to be block granted to governors and states; less money for more flexibility.  Can cover more people for less money.
	Health plan needs to focus on CURES and PREVENTION-not just insurance and treatment; we will never afford a treatment model-outdated badly.
	GOP plan is less "repeal and replace" and more "revise and re-word." Appreciate the effort, but will tweet some specifics to improve it.

	Feeling sorry for Beshear having to follow @POTUS; like having Barney Fife follow Batman.
	Dems poured out of the House Chamber as if someone flushed a commode.  Where were they in such a hurry to go? Is there a sale at Penney's?
	Delighted @POTUS is discussing CURES for disease; not just treatment.  It's only way to approach health care that makes sense.
	@POTUS-powerful, thoughtful, and detailed plan for America. Delivery is strong and Presidential. You think media will treat him fairly?
	@deplorableCort @POTUS don't cook it-just walk it through kitchen and scare it real good?  Maybe a little more than that Courtney. 😁

	@davidaxelrod is standup guy-points out that press smear about pace of Trump transition is ahead of Pres Obama in 08. Axelrod=statesman
	Jeff Sessions great pick for AG.  He was a bold voice to stop TPP when other GOP figures were ready to give away the country.
	@realDonaldTrump has dinner w/o press;say it's their job. Their job is fairly report news and they have miserably failed.  No soup for you!
	"Sources" speculating who will be in Trump gov't-Those who know don't talk; those who talk don't know. Only source who matters is Pres-elect
	Why Trump was elected: Mike Pence channels his inner Trump and tells all lobbyists, “You’re fired!”  https://t.co/hQGUw4P4NY
	The President thinks Obamacare costs no more than a cell phone bill. I’d sure hate to have his cell phone bill! https://t.co/dzNZYtV3NU
	Saddened by news of Cliff Barrows passing.  Long time music director for Billy Graham Crusades. True Christian statesman; Unselfish;Faithful
	On with Megyn Kelly now
	Trump supporters aren't doing violence like the loons on the left, so some Trumpaphobes started some but got caught. https://t.co/Q8Z7Oj0B1a
	Media still hysterical over @realDonaldTrump win; do they not get it that America trusts MSM like Patton trusted Stalin? MSM=0 credibility.
	@RichardGrenell would be great pick for @realDonaldTrump for UN Ambassador -RG has experience;immensely qualified;Articulate; solid choice!
	Harry Reid's hate-filled spit speech on Senate floor new low. A pile of vile bile.Joe Manchin steps up with dignity. https://t.co/hNFEs1UZdA
	Sure glad that libs accept results of free and fair election. We will avoid those riots we had after McCain &amp; Romney losses. #hesmyPresident
	Critics of Steve Bannon know he's smarter and tougher than they are.  When CAIR doesn't like you that is a good thing. Bannon a good guy
	I'll be on w/ Judge Jeanine at 9pm ET on Fox News.  I'll for sure say something that will make the liberal haters have a Twitter-Fit. Watch!
	Force fed CNN at ATL airport-empty heads discussing what Trump will do.  No credibility;they never saw it coming. Just say u are clueless!
	I think NY Slimes is irredeemable despite pledge to do better reporting.  Same with Washington ComPost. All rust and dust but no trust.
	NY Slimes says it will report real news now. Leave your bubble and visit land if God Guns Grits and Gravy! https://t.co/JnaYTpIQ5u
	@realDonaldTrump should thank President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid-they unintentionally made his job easier  https://t.co/nl0MneGRsS
	LOL watching ppl even at Fox who said Trump COULDN'T win now explain how he DID.They scoffed at us who said Trump would win-what arrogance!
	Saw Jerry Seinfeld in concert tonight at local arts center--absolutely drop dead hilarious w/o politics or vulgarity. Worth every penny!
	NFL thinks shorter games brings back fans.  How about telling players to get off their butts and stand during National Anthem? #respectUSA
	@DELTAlast couple of weeks I have trbl adding brdng pass on 2nd leg of trip to wallet. Won't load.
	GrubHub CEO tells employees to resign if they voted Trump. Gotta love "tolerance" and "diversity" from childish liberals. #GrubFLUB
	I enjoy freedom because of the sacrifice of military and their families. Politics can divide, but respect for those who secure peace unite.
	MSM mocked my book "God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy" but had they read it, would have understood Trump movement. https://t.co/scpZLwMVzq
	My prediction spot on-those who ran FROM Trump lost;those who ran WITH him won. @realDonaldTrump will surprise critics as a great President
	Hillary gave gracious concession speech. If you've never been on a ballot it is hard to do. My respect for those who've been in the arena.
	Rachel Maddow interrupted reporting of Trump’s victory to assure viewers that they weren't in Hell. It's true TVs in Hell only show MSNBC.
	About a third of govt. workers claimed they'd quit if Trump won. So voting for him is already working! #reducegovernment
	Excellent beginning for his Making AMERICA Great Again as Trump delivers gracious and great speech.
	Those who prayed for Trump to win must pray for him to lead with dignity, justice, and strength.  The job ahead-YUUGE. But God is able.
	I've had fun at the expense of HRC supporters, but now that Trump has become Pres-elect, it's time for a transition of power and heal USA.
	Trump will offer use of his jet to take the Hollywood celebs to other countries since they declared they would leave country if he won.
	Good thing Hillary canceled the fireworks show she had planned over the Hudson.  eBay will have them on sale soon.
	Shocker:  Oregon, one of the first states to legalize pot, votes heavily for Hillary Clinton.  And Twinkies.
	It's not over yet but the fat lady is backstage running through the musical scales and preparing to sing. And the opera will be over.
	Wouldn't wanna be under that giant glass ceiling if Hillary is forced to concede. That party might end like Carrie's prom.
	New Fox studio pretty skippy. Even bathrooms are bigger than our 1st apartment. https://t.co/10r8Cg96FN
	HRC loses Arkansas by YUUUUUUGE margin.  Keep in mind:  these are the folks (like me) who know her best!
	If HRC wins she will appoint her Filipino maid to head CIA.  She already has access to all the secrets anyway. No need to train her.
	On set at Fox ready to tell it like it is!  With a selfie. https://t.co/CYuEqrcIa2
	Analysts say election will be determined by after-work voters. If you have a job, or ever want one, go vote Trump.
	Dems putting "I Voted" stickers on Susan B. Anthony's tombstone. They know Susan B. was very pro-life and probably wouldn't have voted HRC?
	Dems put "I Voted" stickers on Susan B. Anthony's tombstone. Dems could put those stickers on LOTS of tombstones. https://t.co/UJNZcrrzSZ
	State Dept says it takes 5 yrs to review 31,000 Hillary emails. Let Comey do it!  He can review 650,000 in 1 week!  https://t.co/YQoBrwah48
	Says it all! https://t.co/mwxL17CMCG
	Tired of gov't screwing you over? No accountability or rule of law for the elite? YOU have the power to stop it.  Your VOTE.  Do your duty!
	Politics always about donors, but with HRC, it's about hundreds of millions of FOREIGN donors who will OWN her-and our country-#neverHillary
	I personally know both candidates;Have for years; Not hard choice. Neither are perfect-nor am I, but voted Trump w/o hesitation. Hope you do
	Believe no one is above the law? You can't vote for HRC; Believe a baby deserves better than being ground like sausage? You can't vote HRC.
	Will be on @megynkelly tonight at 9et.  Will discuss state of race and make prediction about tomorrow.   Hint--Trump beats the Grump 😁

	Advice for Jim Comey: Get a dog; it's only friend you'll have in DC; GOP and Dems have both been outraged by his actions during election.
	FBI, DOJ and the media all refuse to do their duty to save the rule of law. It’s now up to the last line of defense. Voters, do your duty!
	HRC's maid had classified material, but FBI's Comey channels Sgt. Schultz-"I see NOTHING."  New TV Hoover's Heroes-https://t.co/SGyex0kigS
	Aesop prophesying about Hillary? "We hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office." No worry-the MAID will clean it up

	With Govs Rick Perry and Phil Bryant in PA--Unionville 8:30 and Lancaster at 9am this morning as we STUMP for TRUMP and Dump the Grump-HRC!
	In 2 speeches branding Trump a narcissist, Obama mentioned himself 207 times. That word doesn't mean what he thinks it means.
	Obama urged men to look inside themselves to find and overcome the thing that keeps them from voting for Hillary.  Like maybe a conscience?
	On the sofa with the ladies of Outnumbered right now.  I'm trying to hold my own. These ladies are good!  I'm outnumbered and outclassed!
	Low IQ media don't get my earlier tweet about car wreck.   @realdonaldTrump will bend fenders but is a vehicle going right way.
	With Dagan on @MariaBartiromo https://t.co/3y64ndGLQA
	Trump may be a car wreck, but at least his car is pointed in right direction.  Hillary is a drunk-driver going the wrong way on the freeway.
	On @MariaBartiromo all day so watch and be amazed. I love Maria.  Smart conversation.
	Trump is Happy Warrior; Hillary is angry lady in neighborhood who didn’t answer the door on Halloween night; it's the Trump vs. the Grump!
	@JHoganGidley especially when you have dinner at Patsy's, the classic NY taste of Italy.  Umm!
	Will be on @KellyFileFNC tonight.  If you don't watch Anthony Weiner will text you!(and trolls--don't get your panties in a wad) smile! 😁
	Harry Reid demanded FBI look at Trump ties to Russia-the “bear in the woods.”   FBI found the charges are what the bear leaves in the woods.
	Only 11% believe Hillary is "honest and trustworthy." 14% believe in Bigfoot.  I wonder who that 11% could be?  #gullible
	@sebring1006 I let them whine-I find their drivel amusing and the the time they waste keeps them from hurting themselves with sharp objects
	To the vulgar trolls whose small brains demand that I do things physically impossible--follow A. Weiner instead of me-better fit for you🐴📵
	Cubs can't win but did. @realDonaldTrump can't win but he will! Congrats to Cubs and now #NeverHillary
	I'll be on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm ET.  The segment will be called "Killing Huckabee."  Bill wants to make book out of it. Don't miss!
	As Hillary leaves rally email questions continue to dog her.  To be frank she is in trouble. https://t.co/YATunA7xW8
	CNN has cut ties w/contributor Donna Brazile for giving HRC advance questions. HRC gets ENOUGH help from CNN already!
	It seems that if it weren’t for double standards, the Clintons and their acolytes would have no standards at all.  #NeverHillary
	A. Weiner reportedly cooperating with FBI; why no warrant to access his laptop.  Weiner is always eager to share his laptop with the world.
	FBI emails not trending on Social Media, say Social Media.  REALLY?  Hey, Twitter, I'm tweeting about them NOW.
https://t.co/9dbeOdwoqM
	Dems say "Its the Russians!"  "The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming!"  
https://t.co/bVebGfYH4o
	Comey's fault;Trump's fault;Weiner's fault--with Hillary, the only "Buck that stops here" is one with pic of George Washington-pay for play!
	Russia serves the same purpose for Democrats that a scantily-clad assistant serves for a magician whose tricks aren’t fooling anyone anymore
	Breaking news!  Harvey Keitel aka "The Wolf" seen entering Hillary's home in Chappaqua.  Stay tuned.
	Sailor takes photo of sub-gets 1 year term in big house; Hillary careless with top secrets, lies,destroys evidence--seeks 4 yr term in WH
	Solve prison overcrowding--let out all who did what Hillary did or less.  If Presidency required security bckgrnd check, HRC would fail it.
	Who would have thought a Weiner would be HRC’s undoing?😱
	I always know when my tweets "tweak" humorless libs--they respond with potty mouth profanity and personal attacks.  It's all they've got!
	Difference between Clintons and Sopranos?  Sopranos didn't leave an email trail.
	Ranchers in OR got off-prosecutors didn't prove defendants’ INTENT to impede feds. It was “HRC Defense” liberals have touted for months.
	Never Trumpers jumped off GOP, but Hillary so corrupt they are jumping back on; "Jump to Trump" new Olympic sport. Gov't can't be HRC's ATM!
	Stench of corruption wafting off Clinton Fndntn becomes so eye-watering that even MSNBC hosts can’t keep donning gas masks and ignoring it.
	Like a dead beached whale, Obamacare is decomposing in front of us and stinking up the place. Think HRC, aka Hillarycare 93 is answer? NOT!
	My 3 yr old grandson saw me on TV and said, "Papa's on TV--just like Mickey Mouse."  To Lil Huck, being in same medium as Mickey matters!
	Emails show Team HRC must have felt like they joined the circus, handed shovels and told to walk behind the elephants. Shovel ready jobs?
	@SouthardLaverda go to https://t.co/OFODNN8sdk
	Go with me to Israel Feb 11-21.  https://t.co/OFODNN8sdk; if Hillary wins (God forbid!) you can book your travel one way!
	GA pastor ordered to give sermons to govt--then gets fired from state job. GA is shredding 1st amendment. Wake up @NathanDeal!  Speak up!
	HRC dangerous-she is surrounded by ppl who won't tell her no. She acts recklessly w/ the law the truth and life.  And her ppl do nothing.
	The New Yorker endorsed HRC.  In related stories, Wimpy endorsed hamburgers, Dracula endorsed blood banks, and ticks endorsed Lyme disease.
	Not voting is giving Hillary an unchecked vote.  Reckless as letting 16 yr old boy have A corvette and case of Coors.  Somebody gets hurt.
	@oreillyfactor shredded smug and arrogant elitist Jen Rubin of Wash ComPost last night in epic smackdown-trip to ER for her after that!
	When ppl can't trust top cops (FBI) who can they trust?  This is far bigger than @realDonaldTrump and HRC.  This threatens rule of law.
	Only a Jordan River baptism will cleanse stains from FBI after Comey and now asst director/HRC lackey reveal political use of FBI.
	McAuliffe/Dems give $500K to VA St Sen cand-wife of ass't FBI Dir who "investigated" HRC.  All the Febreze in USA couldn't clear this stink!
	If GOP loses Senate, it's not because candidates ran WITH @realDonaldTrump; but because they ran FROM him. No time for wimps and wusses!
	Gettysburg speech by @realDonaldTrump strong as a Chuck Norris face kick.  Joe Biden doesn't really want to go behind the gym with Trump!
	How can a true conservative help Hillary by not helping @realDonaldTrump?  They can't.  Pro-abortion globalist Hillary?  No way.
	Was Bubba Clinton talking about Joe Biden when he slammed "old, angry gray haired white guys?" Say it ain't so, Joe! Say it ain't so!
	HIllary is like a Samsung 7 phone--you never know when she will blow up and set something on fire.  Like our country. Vote @realDonaldTrump
	VP Biden says he'd like to physically beat Trump.  Holding my breath while Dems line up to condemn his violent language....turning blue!
	"Most transparent govt ever" exposed by Wikileaks to be the most dishonest and devious ever.
	God, Guns, Grits, Gravy--my NYT bestseller truly explains this election and clash btwn elites and middle America; read it--it makes sense!
	I'll be on Fox News' Newsroom at 10:10am ET today.  Discussing Trump comment about election results.  Hope you watch!
	Hillary horrified any major party candidate would challenge results of a presidential election. Has she never met Al Gore?
	Congrats to Chris Wallace who didn't make it about him.  Tough questions to both; let them actually debate.  Good for him!
	HRC says life work is children-unless they are in womb-then God help them; Hillary won't!  And for women--unless they are in Saudi Arabia
	HRC might have to be helped to the Scooby Dooby Doo Van after debate.  @realDonaldTrump brought a gun to the knife fight tonight.
	@realDonaldTrump to HRC:  You're fired!  Quoting Podesta's emails was brutal. Revealed her own team don't trust her. Neither should American
	"one for the money" HRC preaching ethics is like Jeffrey Dahmer teaching in culinary school
	@realDonaldTrump-bam! Crushes it on HRC being wholly owned subsidiary of Wall Street and corporate interests.
	@realDonaldTrump just put HRC in outhouse comparing General possibly serving 5 yrs for one lie; HRC has more whoppers than Burger King
	HRC just bragged about education in AR; I had to clean up after her mess!  I could afford Trump's jet fuel bill easier than her reforms!
	When HRC says "invest" she means more spending, more debt, more gov't, more cronyism for Clintons; no thanks...enough Americans are hurting
	I don't think @realDonaldTrump and HRC will be holding hands and singing Kumbaya at the end of this!  Gloves off; brass knuckles on.
	HRC whining about Russians stealing her emails. I thought she hit the reset button with Russia?  Let's reset her--send her home.
	Choice is between protecting America or an open border globalist--Vote for @realDonaldTrump; easy choice!
	Hillary pretends late term abortion is about health of mother.  The baby dies.  Nothing healthy about that and mother traumatized for life
	HRC says about 2nd Amend--we need to save lives;  she doesn't want to save 1 million a year killed in mother's womb. Are they deplorable?
	In first 2 minutes, we know already why Never Trumpers are wrong--HRC wants unlimited abortion and redefined marriage, gun control.
	Biden vows retaliation against Russia over Wikileaks. They can’t undermine our election process by telling voters the truth about Democrats!
	My mates @4KingandCountry are releasing a drama/love story to theaters today. Take a look: https://t.co/TsfU1gVfVm
	HRC under oath: over 20x "can't remember."  Her political amnesia is deplorable and irredeemable.  Anyone else?  Jail.  HRC? Media kisses
	UN tries to say Israel has no connection to Jerusalem. Time to float UN off in the East River. UN worthless as milk bucket under a bull
	In $225K spch Hillary says open borders.In $400K spch, says cant screen Syrian migrants. In debate give $1 million to tell truth for 90 min
	In future, get rid of "moderators" and let the candidates take the stage and have the debate without self-important media stars
	@dburke95 Good catch---fast typing because I was so livid!
	If Martha Raddazt wants to debate Trump, she needs to run for office!  She a MODERATOR, not a PARTICIPATOR!
	HRC claims to champion children, but it's okay to kill them in mother's womb and make taxpayers pay for it? Women's "health?"
	Gotta love Trump's candor about taxes--of course he takes advantage of tax LAW that favors the rich--like Hillary's pals.
	Few will change their mind because of debate, but moderators seem angry and constipated and clearly pushing Trump, but not HRC.
	People pushing @realDonaldTrump to drop out  didn't want him to drop in.  Didn't like what he SAID-but can't stand what HRC did and would DO
	Taking economic advice from President Obama is like taking fire prevention advice from Mrs. O'Leary's cow.
	Nothing on TV but TV reporters standing out in the hurricane, saying anyone foolish enough to remain in its path is doomed-TV: SMART stuff!
	Kudos to @FLGovScott for exemplary proactive leadership in advance of Hurricane Matthew.  Gov is doing things right to save lives, property
	Michelle Obama at Hillary rally: “We need someone who’s honest and plays by the rules.” I think she attended the wrong rally!
	If you’re tired of alleged debate “fact-checkers” who just parrot the leftist line, here’s an antidote:

https://t.co/JXAbYZljp7
	Tim Kaine seems to think a VP serves the same function for a President as a yappy Chihuahua does for a socialite’s purse.
	Kaine is heading straight for Waffle House.  He's pretty hungry because Pence ate Kaine's lunch.
	Line of the night by Pence as to why Putin would respect Trump--"Strenghth.  Pure and Simple."  BAM!
	Is moderator trying to confirm media is in tank for Hillary?  Sure looks like it.  Pence is having to debate 2 people but doing it well!
	I know Kaine and Pence. Expected more out of Kaine and less from Pence.  Proud of Pence and surprised that Kaine has adopted HRC's anger
	Kaine appears to have had a tall glass of vinegar; Pence appears to have had some good Southern sweet tea. Demeanor matters!
	Kaine is planned and canned.  Pence is relaxed and ready.  Kaine seems angry.  Pence clearly bought A game.
	In Clinton side agreements: FBI agreed to DESTROY the laptops. Now, that's how you close a case! https://t.co/CkMYUw2PIu
	Should Trump release tax returns?  Is it awful if he didn't pay a fortune in taxes like me?  I join @MariaBartiromo at 7am EDT to explain
	Happy Rosh Hashanah! Was just in Israel 10 days and reminded how much we owe to Jewish heritage.  Let's hope next POTUS respects Israel.

	@LarryABlake I'll try not to blow it.  I think I owe it
	Hillary shows contempt for people in her "basket".  I think she blew a gasket.  Her campaign headed for a casket.

	Reporting on Gary Johnson’s faux pas, the New York Times misidentified Aleppo as the de facto capital of ISIS (that’s the city of Raqqa).

	Press allowed on Hillary's new plane, but are bound, gagged, and riding in cargo compartment unless they contribute to Clinton Foundation.
	Hillary has new plane, but almost couldn't take off--way too much baggage!  Dumped some emails; tossed some devices--good to go!
	Intel expert John Schindler says Hillary's FBI interview shows she's either criminal or dumb, "there is no third choice."

	If Hillary is the most-prepared Presidential nominee ever &amp; Trump is an ignoramus, why does she need a month off to prepare to debate him?
	Why did Hillary turn down an invitation to visit Mexico? Does the FBI consider her a flight risk?
	Hillary slammed Trump's meeting with a foreign leader. It wasn't secret, and he didn't even get a donation! He's doing it all wrong!
	Worse Mexican experience for Hillary than Montezuma's Revenge: Trump on world stage, looking presidential.

	Hillary says Trump can't handle tough questions.  If only he could do what she does --- keep the media from asking any

	How can we fix America's moral decay if we make excuses for politicians who pander on life &amp; marriage to win elections? #IACaucus
	How can @TedCruz say morality a state issue? Morality not geographical. Laws of nature &amp; nature’s God are basis of morality—not a GPS. (3/3)
	I'll fight for life, marriage, &amp; moral issues as President. States do not have the "final say"... God does. https://t.co/xbB8nJkVxY (2/3)
	Do I think life, marriage, and moral issues are "a priority"? Yes, I do. #ImWithHuck #IACaucus (1/3)
	I'll never play political games with my faith. We shouldn't say one thing for votes, and another for NYC money.

	I'll never play political games with my faith or say one thing for votes and another for campaign cash. #ImWithHuck #IACaucus
	Abdicating responsibility to courts on fundamental moral issues like marriage is not leadership — it is surrender!
	Traditional marriage matters. Consistency, honesty &amp; authenticity matter. Moral issues matter, even if they don’t matter to donors.
	Some events remind us just how unimportant politics can be. One of those happened today. Praying for the @RealBenCarson campaign family.
	I don't have an Ivy League law degree, but I know about God's law. Life and marriage are not state issues - they're non-negotiable.
	The snow is coming down at our Des Moines office. 13 days until the #IACaucus! #ImWithHuck https://t.co/j1rfCc5vUY

	In memory of the great Glenn Frey, I wanted to share my 3 favorite Eagles songs:
Take it Easy, Peaceful Easy Feeling and Already Gone
	Sad news in the music world about Glenn Frey. Let's hope Eagles founder closed with a "Peaceful Easy Feeling." RIP
	Wow! I watched #13Hours. The mainstream media has FAILED when Americans rely on Hollywood actors to expose Hillary's actions! #Benghazi
	I reject Republicans who surrender to 'states rights’ on marriage &amp; follow @HillaryClinton lead. We know what's next https://t.co/jULNCBCYpq
	.@HillaryClinton attacking someone for ignoring "requests that were stonewalled"? Hmmmmm... #Benghazi #DemDebate

https://t.co/l0S4AlH26m #DemDebate
	.@HillaryClinton referred to #Obamacare as "a path to universal health care." Finally...admits her goal: a TOTAL govt takeover! #DemDebate
	Equal pay for equal work is already the law. There's no gun show loophole. Dems should learn the laws before trying to rewrite. #DemDebate
	The Dem candidates give their top 3 priorities &amp; none include natl security? Seriously? That's the most IMPORTANT responsibility! #DemDebate
	The people of Iowa are not for sale. Honesty, authenticity and conviction matters.
	I’ll never apologize for my faith, compromise my values, or say one thing for votes and another for campaign contributions.
	While some pandering policiticians believe life, marriage and moral issues are 'not a priority,' I disagree 110 percent.
	Sanctions relief for Iran is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler before WWII hoping Germany will behave.
	Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that's been lying, cheating, murdering &amp; sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years.
	It’s embarrassing John Kerry &amp; Obama negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans still remain locked-up in prison.
	I join millions of Americans and his overjoyed wife Naghmeh in saying, 'Well done Saeed! You are a faithful servant and welcome home!’
	Praise God! Christian pastor Saeed Abedini is free from his 8-year prison sentence for spreading the Gospel &amp; planting churches in Iran!

	Looks like @SpeakerRyan would rather chaperon a Six Flags field trip with El Chapo than listen to more of this speech. #SOTU
	.@POTUS marginalizes and attacks Christians. We need a president who will fight for God &amp; country, &amp; protect our #ReligiousLiberty! #SOTU
	Once @POTUS returns Gitmo to Cuba, the Castros will have more space for political prisoners. #SOTU
	.@POTUS: A threat to Israel is a threat to America, and I will stand with Israel no matter the cost to defeat our common enemies. #SOTU
	.@POTUS: Quit apologizing for the evil forces of radical Islam and start protecting Americans! #SOTU
	What @POTUS fails to mention about #Libya we can probably glean from @HillaryClinton's classified emails. #SOTU
	Unlike @POTUS, I will be a voice of moral clarity and keep all options on the table to defeat the evil forces of radical Islam. #SOTU
	.@POTUS policies intensify the cycle of poverty and government dependency - We need a president who will break it! #SOTU
	.@POTUS immoral deficit spending is bankrupting our grandkids' future. Time for a Balanced Budget Amendment! #SOTU

	.@POTUS tax and spend policies punish working families &amp; encourage government dependency. Why not lift Americans out of poverty? #SOTU
	.@BarackObama's speeches are like @TSA pat downs, Arab relations &amp; untreated rashes. Painfully bad. But it will get worse. #SOTU
	Unlike @POTUS, I'll end the disgrace of failing to give proper care to our veterans who sacrificed everything for our country! #SOTU
	.@POTUS pats himself on the back for giving us an Affordable Care Act that nobody can afford. #SOTU
	Is it true @POTUS thought about doing this #SOTU without Congress? After all, he does everything else without them. #Constitution
	The Iranians are yet again, publicly embarrassing America. This is what happens when your enemies don't fear you.
	Iran should immediately release our sailors or face serious consequences. Yet Obama lacks the power &amp; respect to secure that demand.

	.@HillaryClinton How can you be 'honored' by baby butchers? If 'Womens rights = human rights' do women in womb not count? #PlannedParenthood
	#PlannedParenthood harvests human organs like they were fan belts for a Buick, but @HillaryClinton is 'honored' to have their endorsement?

	If you're unsure about the Obama-Hillary refugee relocation program–the chaos in Europe is a shocking sneak preview. It must be stopped! 5/5
	I’m sorry, but American women should not have to wear burkas to protect themselves from sexual attacks. 4/5
	Liberals call for ‘tolerance’ as the Muslim male rape epidemic swells across Europe. And the politically-correct media has remained silent
	Why are Obama &amp; Hillary more interested in protecting the image of Islam than protecting American women from rape by Middle East migrants?
	Between shootings, terrorists bombings and rampant sexual attacks, this Middle East refugee crisis has been a disaster across Europe.
	So, @POTUS can impose strict gun laws on all Americans to stop "1 shooter" but strictly vetting all immigrants to stop 1 terrorist is wrong?

	Instead of stealing benefits from seniors, let's protect Social Security, preserve Medicare and keep our promises to seniors.
	Americans shouldn't sacrifice their Social Security benefits so we can bailout irresponsible Washington politicians.
	...until we have an administration that treats them as the heroes they are!
	And, seriously: I resolve to keep bringing up the shameful treatment of our veterans every chance I get...
	...flying to far-flung luxury destinations  could easily be conducted via Skype.
	I resolve to keep pointing out that all those climate change conferences involving dozens of fuel-guzzling private jets...
	I resolve to get through the final year of Obama’s assault on freedom with the confidence that we can stop it and turn it around.
	BUT at the same time not to provide any “safe space” from the First Amendment.
	I resolve to offer a warm, reassuring hug to anyone traumatized by any non-P.C. comments I might make
	I resolve the next time a Silicon Valley billionaire or an A-list star praises socialism, I will suggest they give half their money to me.

	Why are the @TheDemocrats more upset about @BernieSanders having access to @HillaryClinton's computer system than Russia, China, &amp; Iran?
	You'd think @HillaryClinton would've at least had a secure computer system for something important, like her campaign.
	You’d think our government would put Americans first, but Washington is putting Americans last.
	Congress is stabbing the American people in the back, yet some Republicans have the nerve to call it a back massage.
	It's a handout to potential terrorists, illegal immigrants, Planned Parenthood, ObamaCare beneficiaries, lobbyists and liberals.
	This 2000-page, $1.1 trillion budget deal is a disgusting mess and Republicans got nothing.

	Facts are facts, &amp; this is clearly radical Islamic terrorism. It's time for @POTUS to stop masquerading as a leader &amp; start acting like one.
	…But today, he seems consumed w/ creativity to generate an alternative explanation for what is explicitly self-evident.
	Yesterday, @POTUS moved w/ lightning speed to advance his radical gun agenda…
	Concealing the truth &amp; ignoring the obvious for the simple sake of a pro-Islam PR campaign is an insult to the American people.
	It doesn't take a Harvard law degree to identify the inspiration and source of the San Bernardino slaughter: radical Islamic terrorism.

	Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants, but it's clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones. #UCCshooting
	There were 50 shootings in Chicago the past two weekends, and this administration failed to utter a word. Why? #UCCshooting
	Gun violence is a problem in this country, but it's not the 2nd Amendment’s fault. It's fault of evil people doing evil things. #UCCshooting
	With few facts, Obama is quick to politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda. #USSshooting
	My prayers are with everyone in Oregon. May the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, guard your hearts.

	Let's burn down the corrupt Washington political machine &amp; rebuild America before it’s too late ➡️ http://t.co/rfTM7f79FE #ImWithHuck (11/)
	Pass a balanced budget amendment. I did it for 10 years as gov despite facing the most Democrat legislature in America. Why can’t DC? (10/)
	End the Department of Education. Education is a family function, not a federal one. Kill Common Core and restore common sense. (9/)
	Stop raiding Social Security. Washington has done enough lying and stealing. It's your money, not the government's. (8/)
	Abolish the IRS and pass the #FairTax. Enough tinkering with the tax code to benefit Washington elites, we need a tax revolution. (7/)
	Require Congress to get healthcare from VA. No American vet will ever rot &amp; die again if they're waiting in line alongside a Senator. (6/)
	No pay for political campaigning. Resign if you decide to run for an office other than the one you currently hold. (5/)
	No budget, no pay for the President or Congress. If the President or Congress won’t do their job, they don’t get paid. (4/)
	Lifetime ban on lobbying for members of Congress. Going to Washington should not be a career. (3/)
	Term Limits for Congress and judges. Do your service and return home. (2/)
	My plan to transform Washington and transfer power back to the people... (1/)

	It may just be @Pontifex's visit that pushes out of touch political class in DC to reject judicial tyranny &amp; stand for #ReligiousLiberty.
	The media mocked &amp; derided millions of Americans who supported #KimDavis' constitutional right to #ReligiousLiberty.
	.@Pontifex recognized something the DC/Wall Street chattering class will never understand - #KimDavis followed her conscience &amp; convictions.
	While the media elites were slobbering b/c @Pontifex commented on climate change, he held a quiet &amp; powerful meeting w/ a humble KY clerk.

	America's workers shouldn’t get punched in gut w/ another job-killing mandate b/c @BernieSanders is running circles around @HillaryClinton.
	In America, we should never allow socialists the power to determine our destiny or destroy our economy.
	Buried amidst #PopeInUS fanfare, @HillaryClinton's sudden #KeystonePipeline opposition makes clear she's running scared from @BernieSanders.
	I'm not a Catholic, but as a Christian and American I believe @Pontifex deserves much better. And so do the American people. #PopeInUS
	.@POTUS bowed to a Saudi King &amp; a Japanese Emperor. Why no respect for @Pontifex &amp; Catholics?My op-ed ➡️ http://t.co/TfvVfmTBKY #PopeInUS

	I commend him for his courage to step into the difficult presidential arena. He entered the race w/ honor &amp; left w/ honor &amp; grace. (2/3)
	Re Gov. Walker's decision: As difficult a decision as it is to start a run for president, it's even more challenging to stop the race. (1/3)
	Why is it that @POTUS goes to extremes to accommodate Muslim terrorists but shows nothing but disdain for Christians? #PopeInUS
	.@POTUS show of disrespect for @Pontifex is a new low for an admin that will go down as most anti-Christian in American history #PopeInUS
	Classless decision by @POTUS to transform @Pontifex visit into a politicized cattle call is an insult to millions of Catholics #PopeInUS

	I stand w/ Kim Davis &amp; Americans of faith under attack by Washington elites who have nothing but disdain for our faith &amp; the Constitution.
	Congress made no law allowing same sex marriage. Kim doesn't have Constitutional authority to issue marriage license to homosexual couples.
	I spoke with Kim Davis to offer my prayer &amp; support. She is showing more courage &amp; humility than most federal office holders in Washington.

	(3/5) It's time to build America's economy, not China's or Mexico's, &amp; quit importing cheap labor &amp; exporting jobs overseas.

	Sorry we had to postpone 1st event in Independence but our flight was canceled due to weather. The rest of IA schedule should be fine!
	Higher education, like K-12, is a state function, not a federal one. And Governors can deal with this far better than @HillaryClinton.
	Most imptly, we must grow our economy b/c if our children &amp; grandchildren can't find good-paying jobs, everything else=political theater.
	We must stop overlooking the importance of trade schools and reject a one-sized-fits-all college plan for every American.
	We must hold colleges that saddle students with mountains of debt accountable.
	(2/2) ...$350 billion in new government spending is no way to solve a college debt crisis that is crushing American families.
	(1/2) While @HillaryClinton proposes government bailouts for states, government handouts for schools and band-aides for irresponsibility...

	I will stand with our ally Israel to prevent the terrorists in Tehran from achieving their own stated goal of another Holocaust.
	"Never again" will be the policy of my administration.
	For decades, Iranian leaders have pledged to "destroy," "annihilate," and "wipe Israel off the map" with a "big Holocaust."
	What's "ridiculous and sad" is that @POTUS does not take Iran's repeated threats seriously.
	"If they [Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide." - Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader

	We must end the scourge, sin, and slaughter of abortion and then we should ask God’s forgiveness for not doing it much, much sooner.
	I’m shocked that an American like Ms. Richards could justify such evil.
	It should enrage all, that our govt confiscates money from our paychecks to bankroll these barbaric butchers with $500 million each year.
	Since 1973, abortion has ended the lives of 60 million babies.
	Cecile Richards should apologize for her barbaric defense of harvested human organs.
	Planned Parenthood isn’t a healthcare provider any more than Benghazi was a ’spontaneous protest.’

	The IRS is intrusive, invasive, unaccountable, and out-of-control. The IRS must be abolished, once-and-for-all. http://t.co/gKTESqZAoA

	Hillary's speech had so many warmed-over leftwing cliches, it didn't come with hashtags, it came with rehash-tags.
	(2/2) The American people deserve a President who speaks with them and works for them, and @HillaryClinton is not it.
	(1/2) I've answered more questions in the last two hours than @HillaryClinton has in the last two months.

	Since 2000, US has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs. Giving more power to a President who has abused his power makes no sense. #TPA
	The Obama Admin has fooled Americans for too long. Republicans needs to wake-up before it’s too late. #TPA
	Destroying American manufacturing is no way to fuel an economy. We’ve already outsourced millions of jobs to Asia, isn’t that enough? #TPA
	I have no idea why some in Congress think we can “take Obama’s word." What will it take to realize that Pres Obama can’t be trusted? #TPA
	Giving foreign judges and diplomats the power to enforce the law and overrule American voters is unconstitutional and un-American. #TPA

	I applaud the hard work by @SenatorSessions &amp; other conservatives who're standing strong against Obama &amp; fighting for American workers. #TPA

	As president, I will lead with moral clarity and restore America’s strength in the world and we need to quit apologizing for being America.
	The only thing President Obama has restored in the White House is an ineptitude we haven’t seen since the Carter Administration.
	On Monday @BarackObama claimed to have “restored the USA as the most respected country on earth.” Is Obama delusional or disingenuous?
