Cotton asks #Sessions about the normalcy of senators meeting with ambassadors. But that's not what happened here. https://t.co/hI3ZRvRp3H
Sen. Cotton says senators should be asking Sessions--who has recused himself from the Russia investigation--about collusion with Russia.
Sessions also says he never got a briefing on Russian interference of the 2016 election. #SessionsHearing
He also seems to be encouraging the President to invoke executive privilege. #SessionsHearing
Sessions says he's not answering questions "in case" the President wants to invoke executive privilege in the future. #SessionsHearing
Sessions, who has mandated strict mandatory minimums, invokes the good-guy and don't-remember defenses.
Sessions also keeps invoking the "You *know* me, colleagues!" defense. #SessionsHearing

There is nothing new under the winter sun.
And when the Kremlin lied about number of anti-Kremlin protestors, it didn't matter because the Kremlin media quoted them, not organizers.
An aside: When Muscovites protested, the Kremlin always cut the actual number of protestors in half and said the rest was just press.

It's interesting that "the American people don't care" is, apparently, now a legal standard.
What the American people will see is a stack of papers and the long, legalistic explanation by this woman, and consider the conflicts solved
Trump says that he is, essentially, Lady Bountiful, doing the country‚Äîwhich doesn't care‚Äîa favor by distancing himself from his business.
Look at all these documents. Now, David Copperfield will eat them all while submerged in a tank of water.
Winning as Q.E.D.
Trump: "I would be able to run my business and run the country at the same time."
"I have no loans in Russia." "I have no deals." "I have no debt." 		If only there was a way to prove it, like by releasing tax returns.
Trump's response to #GoldenShowerGate: "I'm also too much of a germaphobe, believe me."
Trump now using the words "asset" and "Putin" in the same sentence. It's almost like he doesn't get it.
Be careful, Mr. PEOTUS: "Look at the things that were hacked."
Agree with #RexTillerson: Russia is not unpredictable.
#RexTillerson whenever a protest breaks out in the hearing: https://t.co/FHBaCyWNIF
#RexTillerson's m.o. at the hearing: agree or ask for more information. I imagine this is how he talks to Putin and others?
Hard to tell if this just #RexTillerson playing the corporate, don't-ruffle-your-client's-feathers game, or if he believes this stuff.
#RexTillerson: "People who speak up for freedom in repressive regimes often have these things happen to them." https://t.co/UOYvV4KFLu
Rubio: "Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?"	#RexTillerson: "I would not use that term."
@AlexHortonTX Agreed.
So sounds like #RexTillerson is an actual Republican‚Äîunlike his would-be boss.
Rubio asks #RexTillerson if Russian interfering in U.S. elections could only have been done with Putin's approval. Tillerson agrees.
Has #RexTillerson talked to his would-be boss? Or read his party platform?
#RexTillerson says Ukraine should've acted with more military force to show Russia "that there will be no more taking of territory."
#RexTillerson says Ukraine should've beefed up its military response in the east when Russia invaded. Has he read his party platform?
#RexTillerson says he supports the Magnitsky Act sanctions.
#RexTillerson says Russia has no legal claim to Crimea. Putin's going to be pissed.
"We need an open and frank dialogue with Russia," says #RexTillerson.
Wow. #RexTillerson calls out Russia for "invading Ukraine, taking Crimea," and aiding atrocities in Syria.
Unsurprisingly, #RexTillerson thinks defeating ISIS "must be our foremost priority in the Middle East."
