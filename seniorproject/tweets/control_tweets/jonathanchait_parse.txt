@AnnieLowrey @ezraklein Wow, I've never seen a person take their spouse's firing so well.
@elspethreeve Thanks. Yeah alt-right is tricky because the label's been contested/co-opted by outright white supremacists.
8. White supremacists also have a strong tendency to fixate on Jews controlling the US government. Few standard Republicans do.
7. Of course, there has always been some relation between the two, and Bannon and elements of the alt-right have spread into the gap.
6. This passage from David Duke is an example of something a Republican, even Trump, would not usually say: https://t.co/aZx50eFF5o
5. A Republican might advocate policies that advantage whites, but would not identify himself as a spokesman for white rights.
4. White supremacists formulate their views in intensely race-conscious ways. They explicitly identify as champions of white rights.
3. Conservatives tend to express their views on race in race-neutral terms, and typically deny/downplay the existence of racism.
2. distinctions such that a single defining trait would NEVER be found outside the defined group. That said...
