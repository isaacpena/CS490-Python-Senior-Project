	The war against the Taliban has evolved over the past 15 years into a global kaleidoscope of proxy wars and it seems like a mistake.

	Meanwhile, paired with high tariffs the US pursued something close to an open borders immigration policy.
	The idea of a welfare state in the modern sense didn’t really exist, so Republicans pushed for expansion of Civil War pensions instead.
	Infrastructure (i.e. railroads) and higher education were financed via land giveaways so there was no need to spend money on them.
	That could have been used to support a strong military to enforce Reconstruction but the Compromise of 1877 precluded that.
	Republicans put a high tariff in place for trade policy reasons but it raised a lot of revenue incidentally.
	The politics of the budget surplus in the 1870s and 1880s is kind of fascinating.

	Both revenue streams should be shared, to promote more equity between towns but also to encourage business development and job creation.

	If Corker wants to do something useful for the country he should do some hearings on this looming Iran disaster.
	“Could you describe the main provisions of the Iran deal?” is a question, as far as I’m aware, no journalist has asked Trump.
	It’ll make us look like idiots because it’s extremely idiotic. Downsides include regional war &amp; nuclear proliferation. Upsides don’t exist.
	Part two: Congress doesn’t apply any consequences to Iran, thus hoping that falsely accusing them of violation doesn’t induce violation.
	The plan is to declare that Iran is not complying with the deal even though Iran is in fact complying with the deal. 

But it gets dumber!

	Northam would like people to see it as a race in which in which whether or not people get health insurance is an important topic.
	And fundamentally, Ed Gillespie wants people to see the Virginia governors race as a race in which MS-13 is an important topic.

	The place that has wisely stopped calling itself Lahore Kebab is the best jumbo slice FYI.
	I feel that DC needs to talk more, as a community, about jumbo slice. How is this the one thing that’s immune to change?
	The problem with Trump is that he’s a bad, immoral person who defrauds and abuses others for personal gain. But he’s pretty good at it!
	My guess is Trump is of distinctly above-average intelligence and not at all a moron.

	Political power is lying in the streets and the Greens do not appear to want to pick it up.
	@courtneytenz Danke
	@OlafStorbeck Well, as I said I have no idea what he’s saying. But his body language vis-a-vis Merkel and Katrin Göring-Eckardt is terrible.
	I can’t understand what he’s saying but Christian Lindner really comes across as a condescending prick.
	Red/Green/Yellow is a “traffic light coalition.”
	@MaruhnArmand Yes, I’m aware.
	Black/Green/Yellow are the colors of the Jamaican flag, and Germans also regard the idea as somewhat wacky. https://t.co/7Y7aIlrHut
	Merkel is sitting on a panel with a bunch of other party leaders on a German cable network right now. A strange sight to American eyes.
	Greens still haven't made a statement which seems odd.
	German TV has moved on to stories that matter. https://t.co/cm6l20tCRG
	I could listen to Germans say the word "Jamaica" all night long.
	Jamaica coalition? Challenge accepted! https://t.co/MuUBsCH1N5
	Schulz proclaims defeat and an end to grand coalitions. Crowd at Willy Brandt house cheers loudly; SPD activists are hungry for opposition.
	Schultz speaking now at Social Democratic headquarters flanked by other party leaders.
	A weird result for Merkel who dominates the field but also saw her party's vote share fall enormously.
	@jbarro Socialism
	Question now is whether SPD will renew the grand coalition or else, as many activists seem to prefer, lead the opposition so AfD doesn't.
	Main center-right and center-left parties both underperforming their polls. Far-right AfD over performing. #BTWahl2017

	As a bonus irony the German political system developed under American occupation; we New better than to replicate our shambles of a system.
	Voter registration is automatic, the election is on a Sunday, and polling places are plentiful so it's convenient to vote.
	Every vote counts equally in the German system so parties mobilize voters in all parts of the country -- no swing states or key districts.
	The combination of high turnout and short lines at the German election is a real reminder that democracy can work when leaders want it to.
	Rand Paul working to save Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion while McConnell tries to kill it and both lie furiously is bizarre.
	@chrislhayes The seamless repurposing of anti-Bush songs as anti-Trump songs is fascinating.

	Trump's a film-flam man who in the end betrays the trust of his fans as much as anyone else.
	To exploit the issue for partisan gain, Trump needed to revive it -- couldn't accept a quiet win.
	Kaepernick-haters were winning and had already made him an NFL pariah. Trump got him a bunch of allies and revived #TakeTheKnee.
	One subplot here is that Trump is so irredeemably selfish that he undermines the very culture war causes he appropriates.
	Surely even PR's bondholders can see a selfish reason to not want the island to languish with no electricity for months.
