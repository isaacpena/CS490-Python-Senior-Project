	It was truly an honor to play D&amp;D w/ my wife, Melania. Her role-playing and character were absolutely unique. Very proud! #DnDConvention
	I think his character helps. But I don't think I needed him, no, because--I cleared the dungeon. #DnD https://t.co/4nL3LnYSNa
	Our party is totally divided &amp; our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, Wizard is not looking smart, Fighter is not looking tough!
	We are going to have great gaming in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our campaign. #RNCinCLE #DnDinCLE https://t.co/oQwrhuLdTu
	People are noticing the secret meaning in new Trump/Pence logo! It's floorplan of first level of new dungeon! #DnD https://t.co/f41ztXD8jZ
	#Neverwinter is never more. Crushed in game last night by orc horde. Should have built wall. MAKE FAERÛN GREAT AGAIN! #NeverTrump #DnD
	I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as party leader in my D&amp;D campaign at Convention. https://t.co/n3P04sJHJb
	I’m not angry at Bards. I’m not angry at Druids. I’m not angry at Clerics. I'm angry w/ players for being so stupid. https://t.co/SdoG9th1kI
	Another new poll! Thank you for your support! Join the CAMPAIGN today!  #IplayDnD #DnD https://t.co/uvyHQHShDZ
	Ginsburg’s Paladin embarrassed all with very dumb statements about me being a faker. Her game is shot -quit playing! https://t.co/isTYejdWAJ
	I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to adventuring party. Like a dwarf endorsing an elf. #DnD https://t.co/0A4D4q7h9s
	This campaign is a choice between lawful good - or chaotic evil. I will make Dungeons safe again for everyone. #IplayDnD
	Not only am I the rules &amp; order DM, Gary. I’m the DM of compassion, believe it. The Dungeon Master of compassion. https://t.co/x7z437nugG
	Look what is happening to our quest under WEAK DMing of Obama &amp; players like Hillary Clinton. We're a divided party! https://t.co/7wYmSq4rlH
	Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to retreat to the comforting bosom of my own fantasy world for today.
	Just leaving D.C. Had great game w/ Republican role-players. Very interesting quest! These are people who love D&amp;D! https://t.co/TBLUVN8kFI
	Know what a Lich does well? It kills invaders. It does that so good. It doesn't talk. You're an invader, it's over. https://t.co/XvDIgUdjar
	My character made a lot of GP in Atlantis &amp; left before it sank, great timing (as all know). Great Fighter! #DnD https://t.co/2ncE7R7bDT
	"THE GAME SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"

#DnD
	Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict symbol in last tweet as Magic symbol rather than, um, a tiger claw, or spiky thing!
	"Magic" Hillary -- Makes History!  #IplayDnD #DnDFirst https://t.co/cRex3HbJcF
	When you can't roll it - or role-play it - you can't RPG it. We will MAKE DRAGONS GREAT AGAIN! #IplayDnD
	Media is really on witch-hunt against me. False reporting on donated money used to buy signed Tebow helmet. #LARPing https://t.co/KCBI1cKqaJ
	Why would D&amp;D players want Crooked Hillary as their Dungeon Master? She will destroy them!

...With Bugbears.
	The reason I put up approximately $50 for my DM Manual is very simple, I want to MAKE DUNGEONS GREAT AGAIN! #DnD https://t.co/vrOpyRL7Hm
	We must do everything possible to keep this horrible gelatinous cube outside our chamber. The cube is unrelenting. https://t.co/E6CeGxYd1P
	.@Gawker is all negative when it comes to me. I don't read it anymore. https://t.co/UrmY6V1mJS
	Why would @Wizards_DnD be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better &amp; stronger char. classes or that I want penalties for cheaters?
	Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to join my D&amp;D campaign though I'm sure he would do a good job role-playing if he was. https://t.co/O5uN3X7lBM
	Yet another gnoll ambush attack, this game session. Will the players party ever realize what is going on? So sad. #DnD #Dungeonmaster #Trump
	I understand Fantasy. Maybe better than anybody, ever. Someone said Im the RA Salvatore of 140 characters. #100posts https://t.co/JUMVtxJ4IY
	I have never liked the media term 'total party kill'-- but we must enforce the rules of the game! #DnD #Dungeonmaster #tpk #Trump2016
	I don’t want to have characters die. But if they do, I do well. &amp; if they don't, I do well. I do well in any case. https://t.co/TYluCFyhUv
	Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild for D&amp;D. They took their campaign back, just like we will take ours. Role-playing games! #DnD
	Many people are equating DRIZZT, &amp; what is going on in the Forgotten Realms w/ what's happening in my game. People want their campaign back!
	Self-determination is the sacred right of all PC's, and Gary has exercised that right for all the table to see. #DnD https://t.co/POXrfIQ1l1
	I've been dealing with gamers all my life. All my life. &amp; I've always gotten them to do what I need them to do. #DnD https://t.co/BHKxm78ckJ
	#IplayDnD https://t.co/dc7I9QFiYa
	"I know you are, but what am I?" #IplayDnD https://t.co/fXuGtNIs3U
	I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed Dungeon Mastering of Crooked Hillary Clinton. #DnD https://t.co/YD6JMmhzYz
	By self-funding my D&amp;D campaign, I am not controlled by WotC or special interests. I'm only working for the players! https://t.co/4jMgSaEyeo
	Sorry haters, my fighter's IQ is the highest and you all know it! Don’t feel stupid &amp; insecure. It’s not your fault. https://t.co/tmwt8UMbsI
	Donald Trump's D&amp;D Game Is a Game Changer. #Trump2016 https://t.co/48HkrAJPpf
	Player characters must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant. Thank you @MITHicalGaming! https://t.co/Ix1VHTdXei
	My new dungeon is going to beat Hillary &amp; it would be helpful if the Republicans could help a little bit. You know? Okay? Just a little bit.
	Failing @NYTimes shows empty room hours before my game night started, when it was packed! So totally dishonest! #DnD https://t.co/g7OOA2d8OS
	THANK YOU! #DungeonsAndDragonsFirst https://t.co/jxe7e7m0R7
	I’m gaming with myself, number one, because I have a very good character and I’ve explored a lot of dungeons. #Trump https://t.co/bZeUr8kmm6
	If you don't tell people about your success at inventing monsters, they probably won't know about it. #DnD #Trump https://t.co/HUf5WsrYpU
	Somebody said my character owns the greatest Bag of Holding collection ever &amp; I believe that to be 100% true. #Trump https://t.co/upGUfDyOgl
	.@Wizards_DnD is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart gaming style directly to the players!
	Thank you to the D&amp;D community! I will fight w/ you while Hillary brings more monsters to threaten your character. https://t.co/H2HxtgZqjX
	Today is Donald Trump's Birthday! Send him your D&amp;D Birthday wishes here: #TrumpDnBDay https://t.co/BYcZEtUKGx
	DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS FIRST!
	Based on the incredibly inaccurate role-playing in the Trump D&amp;D campaign, we are hereby banning @washingtonpost from playing with us. #DnD
	Obama doesn’t get D&amp;D, or he gets it better than anybody understands. It’s one or the other. And either one is unacceptable. #DnD #POTUS
	Is President Obama going to finally mention the words chromatic dragon tyrant? If he doesn't he should immediately stop playing in disgrace!
	Appreciate the congrats on congrating myself for being right that your character would fail. I don't want congrats. We must play smart! #DnD
	I'm not a racist, in fact, I am the least racist person that you’ve ever encountered. My character has no race. #DnD https://t.co/N9mS4QJlNR
	I rarely agree with President Obama- however he is 100% correct. Learn to hoard GP &amp; kill orcs too. Great ad! #POTUS https://t.co/Ok9V9S4d6M
	Galadriel is at it again! Elizabeth Warren's elf, one of the least productive D&amp;D characters, has a nasty mouth. Hope she is asst DM choice.
	Bigly Trumpblade. John the Miller. John the Bishop. #TrumpDnDCharacterName #TrumpSecretServiceCodeName https://t.co/lK69rStY6b
	My character would have had millions of more XP than Hillary's except for the fact that I had 16 other players in party, she had one! #DnD
	Ah, look at my Gary over here, look at him. Are you the greatest? You know what I'm talking about! #LookAtMyGary https://t.co/ahY7DV0it6
	I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women in D&amp;D by letting them play with me. #BigDice https://t.co/kYUypd7Bva
	@JusticeMitchell Definitely a traditionalist.
	I love Displacer Beasts. They're very capable of changing positions to wherever they want. &amp; being a puma is a plus. https://t.co/lGZvPDXExi
	He's proud of his character. He's a wizard. We're building a wall between us and magic. It's a conflict of interest. https://t.co/gbhEgpjMpp
	I am getting bad marks from certain players because I run a small D&amp;D campaign. But small is good, flexible, quick XP and number one! #DnD
	I don't play on @Morning_Joe anymore. Small group, bad quest! I hear Mika has gone wild. Joe is Joe. Lost their way! https://t.co/wCLBiXzHJF
	"@dmartosko: Is this what it's going to be like playing D&amp;D if you're DM?" Yeah, it is going to be like this! #DungeonMaster #DnD #Trump
	@IndelibleWitko I would role-play with Kim Jong-un, I would have no problem gaming with him.
	I'm the biggest thing happening in role-playing. All over the world, they’re talking about it. #Trump #DnD #Winning https://t.co/Y6K7TYB96X
	Even though I have a very biased and unfair DM in the Rise of Tiamat module, I have thousands of great dice rolls &amp; will win campaign! #DnD
	Excuse me. I’ve watched you play, Gary, you’re a real beauty. I find you to be extremely dishonest, Gary. A sleaze. https://t.co/b0NM1yH1tk
	@StevenB_Drums "Great" and "Best" weren't options. So, I went with "Good."
	I have given a tremendous amount of XP to our great PLAYERS &amp; have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. #DnD https://t.co/gEgZNK6kOa
	My character should have easily cleared the dungeon but have a DM, Gonzalo Curiel, who is very unfair, totally biased against me. #DnD
	If @BillKristol does get a lightweight DM to run Indie campaign, we have to be smart &amp; strong w/ our role-playing. https://t.co/4ygKm9STM9
	The players are on a new phony kick about my Dungeon Mastering style. I make fewer dice rolls &amp; get much better results! What we need in DM!
	Well, yes, I've killed a lot of player characters. It's always a lousy task. But I have killed many player characters. #DnD #Dungeonmaster
	Celebrating Level 12! #McDonaldTrump #DnD #invisiblefries https://t.co/BcOrCvrT87
	Great gaming session with @jimmykimmel last night. Though Kimmel's lightweight dungeon totally bombed. #DnD #Trump https://t.co/41MDwlES3p
	The gamers in New Mexico were thugs who were ignoring the D&amp;D rules. My gaming session was big and beautiful, but others, criminals! #DnD
	I'm a designer; I know how to design dungeons. I design the best dungeons. And my name helps a lot. #Trump2016 #DnD https://t.co/FaaCaK2pRM
	In trade, melee and EVERYTHING else, it will be D&amp;D FIRST! This will lead to our ult goal: MAKE DRAGONS GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/p5YeaePUdq
	NPCs are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for orc hordes and goblin raiders! #DnD
	I’m not casting spells anymore— but neither is Chris. You’re not casting spells anymore, Chris. Don’t feel bad. #dnd https://t.co/5rjUhekKF8
	XP and GP were never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game. #DonaldTrump #DnD
	Thank you! An honor to be the first DM ever endorsed by the NLARPA. #NationalLiveActionRolePlayingAssoc #DnD  #Trump https://t.co/iiqpPRIj8b
	Hillary’s thief has zero INT and even less STR. Orcs, Bugbears and all would love for her to attack their lair. #DnD https://t.co/5tJrsCe0Pw
	Thank you Twitter! Congratulations to THE CAMPAIGN. I have the best players. See you soon! #makedragonsgreatagain https://t.co/VOskkruVyV
	I’m going to find the smartest and most successful players to be in my campaign. They will be winners, that I can tell you. #Dnd #Trump2016
	I look forward to playing D&amp;D w/ @megynkelly. Will be interesting what she rolls up—I think she will be an elf. #DnD https://t.co/puU58hr7Cg
	Nobody reads the Monster Manual more than me. The '79 edition means a lot, but I don't want to get into specifics. https://t.co/ydaC7aIkLY
	We used to have victories. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, an owlbear? I beat owlbears all the time. All the time.
	I'm a great Dungeon Master. I literally wrote the book on DMing. #artofthedm #DonaldTrump #dungeonmaster #DnD https://t.co/p355AuTuUQ
	@matthue @alexnazaryan Don't take your character to Oakland until they've at least reached Level 5. Level 8 for Ferguson. Seriously. #DnD
	Tomb of Horrors is scary, like Vietnam. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave warrior. #dnd https://t.co/gnhXbms24b
	@prayerborne That image is from failing #abcnews. They know nothing of D&amp;D. I know words. I have the best words.
	Bernie's druid is being treated very badly by DMs. The rules are rigged against him. He should run his own campaign! https://t.co/kgqhFEExb8
	I am growing D &amp; D tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Pathfinder games are significantly down from years past. #dnd #Trump2016
	I have so many fabulous friends who happen to play MMOs, but I am a traditionalist. https://t.co/hsHjN0xllW
	All of women in my D&amp;D campaign flirted with me — both in-game and out. That’s to be expected. #dnd #dungeonmaster #Trump2016
	Listen, Gary’s not a hero. Gary got captured by goblins. Heroes don't get captured by goblins. #dnd #dungeonmaster https://t.co/QiA7Bjk59H
	I think the only difference between me and other DMs is that I'm more honest and my NPC women are more beautiful. #trump #dnd #dungeonmaster
	I've been playing D&amp;D forever. In the 90's I had great characters like John the Miller &amp; John the Baron. #johnmiller https://t.co/mGcDIOfJCW
	McConnell kept trying to show me his Magic cards. Doesn't understand what "role-playing" is. #demonictutor #trump https://t.co/Y0axcdgHhA
	Ready for huge day of gaming tomorrow. Invited: Lyin' Ted, Crooked Hillary, Crazy Bernie, Goofy Warren &amp; maybe Gary. https://t.co/osBjhCL1gO
	As DM, I’m going to get in &amp; suck all the oxygen out of the room. All the players are going to go crazy. #dnd #trump https://t.co/yIACpIWgzH
	Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton keep insisting on playing women characters. They will lose! #dnd #Trump2016 #womancharacter
	You just rolled a 1, Gary. Look at me, Gary. That's a Critical Failure, Gary. You failed. #winning #dnd #trump2016 https://t.co/prXs3ykbb6
	@SamuelBBurt @mikemearls We will have so much winning if I am DM that you may get bored with the winning,
	I look very much forward to sharing my dungeon map w/Ryan &amp; GOP Players. We'll beat the Dems on each level of it! https://t.co/x67FaQwgSP
	People are always saying how great my dice are. You wouldn't believe it. They're just beautiful dice. #trump #dnd https://t.co/LyGzs7XeN1
	It's only people who were never asked to play D&amp;D with me that tell the press they won't join my campaign. #dungeonmaster #DonaldTrump #dnd
	@sharkfan829 @VoiceOfOBrien Listen, I've got some really great dice. Just amazing dice. They roll all sorts of great numbers. &amp; they're big.
	@nihilist_arbys Did you steal my trapper keeper? You just described the D&amp;D campaign I'm DMing. It's so great you wouldn't believe it.
	Hillary says her thief has got more experience points than Donald Trump. But I had 17 goblins to beat—she had one wereboar! #trump2016 #DnD
	@VoiceOfOBrien Being DM is like being God. And I'm a great GM. I am very strong at being DM. So yes.
	Hillary's thief just can't defeat Bernie's druid. How will she deal with a gang of kobolds or orcs? Bad! #dnd #trump https://t.co/EIuPzrX3NY
	I could stand in the middle of Waterdeep, behead a High Elf, and not lose another player. #dungeonmaster #dnd #DonaldTrump
	Elizabeth Warren claims her goofy and ineffective character is an elf. Let's see what her character sheet says! #dungeonmaster #Trump2016
	Making a new character. Perfect 20s! I roll the best attributes! Nobody rolls better! #Trump2016 #dungeonmaster #dnd https://t.co/6Kvlvzp8NZ
	Is this D20 small? He said 'if it's small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. #dnd https://t.co/U3RD4aAgSk
	When Mexico sends its players, they’re not sending their best. They’re druids. They’re bards. &amp; some, I assume, are lawful good. #dnd #trump
	So much great power-gaming yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put D&amp;D first and MAKE DRAGONS GREAT AGAIN! #dnd https://t.co/OBto1lgNmU
	Gamer Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented DMs running a campaign I've ever seen." Thank you Rick! #trump2016 #dnd
	Happy #dnd_friday! The best campaigns are played in Trump Tower. I love DMing! #DonaldTrump #dnd #dungeonmaster https://t.co/yEsF4KCDTy
	I will build a great dungeon. And nobody builds dungeons better than me. Mark my words. #DonaldTrump #dungeonmaster #DungeonsAndDragons
