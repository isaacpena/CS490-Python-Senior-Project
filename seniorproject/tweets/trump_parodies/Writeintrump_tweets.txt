	My favorite parts of The Wizard of Oz are when the house falls on Ruth Ginsburg and when water melts Crooked Hillary at the end.
	It was okay when Turkey's President #Erdogan was asking for help on #FaceTime but now he's sending me dick pics on Snapchat.
	The rumors are true, the Turkish military have offered to make me their new President.  Very sweet guys, I appreciate it.  #Turkey

	In the tradition of my Miss America pageant Mike Pence won the role of VP after beating Newt and Chris Christie in the swimsuit competition.
	During our first debate I'm going to yell at Crooked Hillary "Liar Liar Pence on Fire!" and my VP Mike Pence will run on stage in flames.
	I picked Governor Mike Pence as my running mate because of his stance on abortion and Rosie O'Donnell.  He hates both!  #TrumpVP
	Even I have to admit Elizabeth Warren looked better than she has in years at tonight's #ESPYS. https://t.co/6pEX7PBpVM

	Bill Clinton denies claims he groped #LorettaLynch during their private meeting.  He was simply checking to see if she was wearing a wire.
	Don't worry Loretta Lynch you're not the first and you won't be the last woman to regret meeting with Bill Clinton alone.  @AnnCoulter
	Crooked Hillary could have avoided this entire scandal if she simply asked Bill to put down Tinder for a second and help her with her email.
	I love America so much that I spent 50 million on my own campaign.  That's so much money it could have kept Rosie O'Donnell fed for a month!
	Since my finalists for VP come down to Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich I'll decide it with a pie eating contest.  https://t.co/wjy04bXq1v
	Hopefully Crooked Hillary will give Loretta Lynch top bunk in their prison cell since Bill Clinton will be the reason she's in there!
	New poll has me leading with 43%.  Crooked Hillary hasn't been this angry at a number since the last time she stepped on a scale.
	Good job U.S. Military for using airstrikes to turn 250 ISIS into 250 WASWAS!
	Of course Crooked Hillary doesn't mind thousands of Muslims entering the US. She didn't even mind when they entered our Embassy in Benghazi.
	Bill Clinton only met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to make sure Crooked Hillary isn't allowed conjugal visits when she's convicted.

	I would Ask The Gays myself but Lindsey Graham changed his cell phone number after I gave it out last year.
	That audience member who yelled "Mitt Romney  is a bitch" at Herman Cain was out of line.  Unlike Romney female dogs are actually loyal.

	I can't believe Lindsey Graham won't take 10 minutes off from hanging out in the men's room at the park to vote for me for President.
	I programmed my DVR to record #Scandal, instead it recorded Hillary Clinton's latest interview.  Honest mistake.  #HillaryDropOut
	I love Hispanics so much that when I'm elected I'm going to give millions of them an all expense paid trip to their homeland.
	In honor of #CincoDeMayo, the Mexican Cooks at El Polo Loco didn't put broken glass in my Taco Bowl.  Thanks guys! https://t.co/NVjxM6pg3q
	I hope every illegal enjoys #CincoDeMayo today because next year they'll be celebrating it on the other side of my wall!
	The good news #TedCruz is you don't have to worry about your Dad's friends trying to assassinate you as President now.  #LeeHarveyOswald
	The best thing about winning the GOP Nomination is it really helped me overcome my fear of public speaking.   #Trump https://t.co/COoMWvU3sS
	I'm shocked John Kasich dropped out. I didn't even know he was still running and from his results in the #IndianaPrimary neither did voters.
	Maybe I'll build my wall out of all the Ted Cruz campaign buttons his supporters threw away tonight. #IndianaPrimary https://t.co/U3yEtIFVev
	I can't believe it God, winning the GOP nomination was even easier than you promised me it would be. #IndianaPrimary https://t.co/ziO7oubh90
	Smile if you're going to have the nuclear codes this time next year.   #IndianaPrimary #TedCruz #NeverClinton https://t.co/V9oCd6FIjh
	Ted Cruz treated the Presidential race like one of his mistresses and pulled out so it wouldn't get pregnant.   #IndianaPrimary
	Hey Ted Cruz the best way to get that stench of losing off you is with some Trump Cologne!  #IndianaPrimary https://t.co/XWpC6zR0LF
	I'm picking up Delegates even easier than I picked up chicks when I was single!   #IndianaPrimary
	After losing the #IndianaPrimary I expect Ted Cruz to quit the race like he quit his murder spree when he was the Zodiac Killer.
	It's #TeacherAppreciationDay so I expect a "Thank You" from Lyin' Ted Cruz and John Kasich for schooling them this election.
	I see Burn the Witch is trending.  What did Hillary Clinton do now?
	After learning that Lyin' Ted Cruz's Dad was BFFs with Lee Harvey Oswald, I finally understand why he grew up to become the Zodiac Killer.
	Heidi Cruz revealed her husband @tedcruz is the not the Zodiac Killer and that the only thing he's ever killed is his Presidential campaign.
	Inspired by her father taking 8 years off as President Malia Obama will take a year off before going to Harvard
	I would go to the White House Correspondents dinner but once again Obama is only serving bullshit.
	It's officially the saddest day of my campaign after global icon @aaroncarter took back his endorsement of me. https://t.co/ZeUfqL2NFc
	Is it racist to ask the illegal trying to turn over your car at my #TrumpRally in Costa Mesa to change the oil first https://t.co/OhqWzmyNsB
	I'm going to have to rethink my wall after discovering Mexicans can climb in Costa Mesa at my #TrumpRally.  #trumpoc https://t.co/1UPcbvvXnu
	I loved visiting Orange County today since it was named after my skin color.   #trumpoc #trumprally
	I completely disagree with John Boehner calling Ted Cruz Lucifer.  Remember Lucifer was good looking.
	The best thing about Bobby Knight endorsing me is  he promised to throw a chair at Hillary during our first debate. https://t.co/dmtDe82DHx
	CNN's Amanda Carpenter isn't surprised Lyin' Ted Cruz picked Carly Fiorina as his VP. He loves having a woman he's not married to under him.
	My speech today was so amazing a paralyzed man in the crowd gave me a standing ovation.  #DonaldTrump
	Ted #Cruz just picked Carly Fiorina as his VP.  I guess that officially makes him President of Fantasyland.  @realDonaldTrump
	Chris Christie has been standing behind me like this ever since I put that Snickers bar in my pocket.  #SuperTuesday https://t.co/mzrcp9ZBOy
	I went for 5 for 5 today, something Lyin' Ted Cruz hasn't said since he tried to sleep with 5 cable news contributors.   #SuperTuesday

	Curt Schilling has been an expert on the Transgender ever since his foot had its first period.   #ESPN https://t.co/JOhYPEpfYK

	Monica Lewinsky is trending.  I forgot why she is famous again.  I'll ask Hillary, maybe she remembers.
	I knew Hillary Clinton was lying during the #DemDebate because I saw her lips moving.
	I haven't seen anyone take 50 shots like Kobe tonight since I watched Hillary Clinton get drunk at the open bar at my wedding.  #MambaDay
	To answer your first question Anderson Cooper, Yes the #TrumpFamily is worth way more than the #VanderbiltFamily. https://t.co/KjoaP6J3mx

	Hey Hillary Clinton when the Feds arrive at your door with handcuffs, you #BetterCallSaul! https://t.co/hV3PGsePLg
	#JohnKasich said he's the only candidate who can win in the fall.  I guess he means when he appears as a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice.
	The #KasichFamily are American heroes for helping millions of people with insomnia fall asleep after watching them on tonight's #cnntownhall
	In honor of #NationalPetDay Heidi Cruz is letting Ted out of the doghouse for sleeping with 5 Mistresses.  #CruzSexScandal
	I could have bought the Boston Globe when it came up for sale a few years ago, but I decided to spend that 500 bucks on something else.

	Lyin' Ted said he wouldn't support me as the GOP nominee.  Then again he also told Heidi he was alone in his hotel room.  #CruzSexScandal
	Luckily I'm in construction so I can fix the holes I punched in the wall after the results of the #WisconsinPrimary. https://t.co/C1bOfR8Zdm
	#ThePeopleVsOJSimpson proves that sometimes the bad guy wins. Actually the Wisconsin primary results prove the same thing.  #cruzsexscandal
	I let Ted Cruz win Wisconsin because his wife Heidi finally deserved some good news after these last couple weeks.  #CruzSexScanal
	If Ted Cruz beats me in Wisconsin that will give him a total of 9 states, which I believe is also the same number of mistresses he has!

	Roger Stone is right!  If the Delegates try to steal my nomination their time in Cleveland will end uglier than Johnny Manziel's did!
	Can someone shut up those screaming alley cats?  Oh wait, it's just Hillary Clinton's appearance on #TheView.
	Michael Jordan is crying after I told him as President I'm forcing all of his Nike shoes to be made in America! https://t.co/jmWDwYQmFQ
	If Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker kissed Ted Cruz's ass any harder he would qualify as Mistress #6.
	The #FinalFour is trending I guess that means Ted Cruz broke up with one of his mistresses.
	I'm losing in Wisconsin which isn't shocking since it's the Rosie O'Donnell of states - Dumb and full of cheese.  #Trump

	The Justice Department announced they won't file charges against Hillary Clinton.  #AprilFools!  Just kidding, she's still going to prison!
	No one will ever accuse Hillary Clinton of being Pro-life, especially anyone who remembers Benghazi. #BernieInTheBronx. #ImSoSick
	I'm so Pro-life I won't even say "Abort!" when calling off a military strike as President.
	To prove to female voters I'm not completely against abortion, I'm driving 4 of Ted Cruz's pregnant mistresses to Planned Parenthood today.
	Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife Wendi Deng is now dating Putin.  At this rate, the next evil man she'll date will probably be Hillary Clinton.
	Michelle Fields had her 6 year old nephew arrested for assault today after he touched her during a game of TAG.  @AnnCoulter
	I'm conflicted about abortion because there's always a chance that baby could grow up to be the next Rosie O'Donnell.
	I tried to make peace with Ted Cruz after the #GOPTownHall but he was busy giving a private interview to CNN's @amandacarpenter in his bus.
	I have to be completely objective, I totally dominated tonight's #GOPTownHall!
	If we don't give Japan Nuclear weapons then how the hell do we expect them to fight Godzilla!  #GOPTownHall
	I've had cookies with the same last name tougher and with more journalistic integrity than Michelle Fields. https://t.co/x6ZRoM9oiM
	Michelle Fields said she'll drop the charges against Corey Lewandowski if I go out with her.  I'm sorry Corey, but I'm not Ted Cruz.
	The only thing my campaign manager Corey Lewandowski bruised on Michelle Fields was her ego!
	The only time Ted Cruz's campaign manager grabs women is when Ted needs help undoing their bra strap.  #CruzSexScandal #Lewandowski
	I've replaced my campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with someone even better at keeping pushy reporters away. https://t.co/WSLIrDKw8A
	Energizer has agreed to sponsor my campaign now that it's linked with a battery charge.  Thanks Corey Lewandowski! https://t.co/0yiMgonMxg
	Susan Sarandon just said if #BernieSanders doesn't win she'll drive off a cliff with Hillary Clinton like she did in Thelma and Louise.

	When Ted Cruz heard his wife scream tonight he thought she discovered  another mistress but she was just watching the end of #TheWalkingDead
	To get my daughter Ivanka's baby to cry after being born, the doctors didn't slap it, they showed it a picture of Hillary.
	Who died on tonight's #TheWalkingDead?  I hope it was a liberal.
	I put a Marshmallow Peep in the microwave to help show what the #CruzSexScandal did to Ted Cruz's campaign this week https://t.co/34OqG2Y0xp
	Sorry Ted Cruz, Jesus may have been resurrected on Easter but your political career won't.  #CruzSexScandal #HappyEaster
	Ted Cruz watched #TheTenCommandments with his family but didn't appreciate them pointing out how many of them he broke.   #CruzSexScandal
	To avoid embarrassing the GOP any further I've requested Ted Cruz wear a chastity belt during Tuesday's Town Hall on CNN.  #CruzSexScandal
	Self-funding my campaign is expensive now that I have to pay for therapy for staffers who had sex with Ted Cruz.  #CruzSexScandal
	Lyin' Ted if I made up a sex story about you it would include midgets, Lindsey Graham and a few gerbils.  #CruzSexScandal
	The National Enquirer is now reporting Ted Cruz might be the Easter Bunny since he screws like a rabbit.   #CruzSexScandal @realDonaldTrump
	Maybe I'll make Lyin' Ted my White House Press Secretary since he clearly knows how to sweet talk Cable News Contributors.  #CruzSexScandal
	No Lyin' Ted won't be President but he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night after Heidi Cruz threw him out.    #CruzSexScandal
	Ted Cruz volunteered to hide the #Easter Eggs on Sunday, but his wife told him he's already hidden enough from his family.  #CruzSexScandal
	Leave Ted Cruz alone! What a man does in the privacy of a campaign bus bathroom with a CNN Contributor is his business.   #CruzSexScandal
	If I never ran, Hillary Clinton would have used the #CruzSexScandal in November to kill Lyin' Ted's campaign quicker than Vince Foster.
	I would have learned about the #CruzSexScandal months ago if I just allowed @KatrinaPierson to bring a date to my campaign Christmas party.
	It turns out Ted Cruz's flat tax would charge small breasted women more money each year than ones with bigger bra sizes.  #CruzSexScandal
	Ted Cruz lost yet another debate last night when he tried to convince his wife Heidi he didn't cheat.  #CruzSexScandal  @realDonaldTrump
	Ted Cruz committed adultery and lied to the American people.  I've fired contestants on Celebrity Apprentice for less.  #CruzSexScandal
	I think it's only fair that if Ted Cruz is going to sleep with anymore of my staffers he should pay half their salary.  #CruzSexScandal
	Moments after a bird flew on stage to interrupt Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz tried to have sex with it.  #BirdieSanders https://t.co/hfRuiA8APF
	One way to prove waterboarding gets reliable info is to use it on Ted Cruz to learn how many of my staffers he slept with. #CruzSexScandal
	I don't think Ted Cruz slept with any of those women.  He's a busy man so he probably left immediately after sex.    #CruzSexScandal
	Rumor has it Lyin' Ted slept with @amandacarpenter in the back of Jeb Bush's campaign bus.
 #CruzSexScandal https://t.co/eBQ2bbZsdy
	The only story I've ever leaked to the National Enquirer was about Rosie O'Donnell being Bigfoot.  #CruzSexScandal #TrumpLovesPecker
	Ted Cruz refuses to drop out of the race but he'll drop his pants at the first sight of a pretty girl.  Baffling.  #CruzSexScandal
	Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  Which is why I just hit Ted Cruz in the face with a rock.  #CruzSexScandal
	I pray that Ted Cruz gets the help he desperately needs, sex addiction is a terrible thing.  Just ask Bill Clinton.  #CruzSexScandal
	I want to set the record straight! I didn't come up with the rumors that launched the #CruzSexScandal, I only wish I did.   #Trump2016
	https://t.co/vIvozRlphe just praised this Twitter account's coverage of the #CruzSexScandal.  https://t.co/pKWdNjJxRO  @realDonaldTrump
	There's a week left before I pick Employee of the Month but I like @KatrinaPierson's chances. #CruzSexScandal https://t.co/QRM64tVchl
	I'm not sure if Ted Cruz slept with my spokesperson @KatrinaPierson but she did buy him this shirt. #CruzSexScandal https://t.co/HtQsBN4XKA
	I warned Ted Cruz not to wear so much Trump cologne. Women find it irresistible! 
#CruzSexScandal @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/7wHgaLq4mb
	It's only a shame that I probably won't be able to find any dirt on the Clintons like the #CruzSexScandal.   @AnnCoulter
	So that's why Ted Cruz was always smiling.  I knew it couldn't be because of his poll numbers.  #CruzSexScandal https://t.co/UdbzU2B5yk
	After seeing the fallout from the #CruzSexScandal I'm definitely glad I turned down all of Megyn Kelly's advances. https://t.co/wpAXZCAoBc
	The #CruzSexScandal just turned this #GoodFriday into a Great Friday!
	In addition to the 5 Mistresses, Ted Cruz has revealed he just fucked his Presidential Campaign.  #CruzSexScandal
	Ted Cruz should just claim the Devil made him do it, which of course Hillary Clinton will immediately deny she did.  #CruzSexScandal
	Ted Cruz wants to be President more than ever now so the Secret Service can protect him from his wife. #CruzSexScandal
	It's kind of unfair that Chris Christie had to drop out of the race and the only thing he cheated on was his diet.  #CruzSexScandal
	Don't stress out Ted Cruz, it's not like you were running a campaign based around the importance of family values.  #CruzSexScandal
	I'm shocked by the #CruzSexScandal.  I never knew Canadians had such an uncontrollable sexual appetite.   #nationalenquirer
	I bought 2 copies of the National Enquirer. One to frame and the other for Ted Cruz's wife to roll up and beat him with it! #CruzSexScandal
	Hey Ted Cruz, on second thought maybe we should have one more debate after all.    #CruzSexScandal #NationalEnquirer @AnnCoulter
	This #CruzSexScandal is getting out of hand, Ted Cruz just sent me a dick pic.  Here it is. https://t.co/7PdZtZdDE7
	Look on the bright side Ted, at least no one is talking about you being the Zodiac Killer anymore. .#CruzSexScandal https://t.co/wGsp0ptAJO
	It turns out Ted Cruz had more mistresses than Jeb  Bush had people who voted for him.    @AnnCoulter. #CruzSexScandal #NationalEnquirer
	Instead of building a wall on the border, I should build one around Ted Cruz's pants since he can't seem to keep them on.    #CruzSexScandal
	ISIS Terrorists call off Jihad after learning Lindsey Graham is one of the 72 virgins they get in heaven. https://t.co/NYwWZ5D08l
	I wish there was a photo that proved Whoopi Goldberg was a hypocrite for saying Trump is a racist. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/7K0sFVfZp8
	I'm sorry for releasing an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz's wife, but those are the only kinds of photos she takes. https://t.co/wHiXAslmoq
	#IfIWerePresident I'd watch a baseball game in a Communist country while terrorists kill 31 people. Oh wait, that's if Obama was President.
	The good news liberals is as President I'll greatly reduce our nuclear arsenal.  The bad news liberals is I'll do it by using them on ISIS.
	Fun Fact: The name Jeb comes from the Hebrew word for Idiot Little Brother Who Will Never Be President.  @realDonaldTrump
	I took on the monster known as Rosie O'Donnell and won, so I'm pretty confident I can defeat ISIS as President.  @DonaldJTrumpJr
	Jeb Bush just endorsed Ted Cruz.  I couldn't tell who Jeb's wife endorsed because I don't speak Spanish.   @DonaldJTrumpJr
	Whenever I need a good laugh I just remind myself that lyin' Ted Cruz is still running for President.  @DonaldJTrumpJr
	Take one look at David Letterman and you'll know why I decided to run for President instead of retiring. https://t.co/3xwCfspXBH
	In honor of #NationalPuppyDay Bill Clinton will only do the Doggystyle position when he cheats on Hillary today.    @realDonaldTrump
	I lost the #UtahCaucus because so many of Ted Cruz's Mormon supporters had multiple wives who voted.   @realDonaldTrump
	To show I'm a good sport I just sent Ted Cruz a case of Arizona Ice Tea.  #ArizonaPrimary @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fVeBCOtk1u
	Authorities report John McCain's face is stuck in a permanent scowl after learning I won his home state of Arizona. https://t.co/1mBVM3Incf
	I was going to spill the beans on Ted Cruz's wife but unfortunately Chris Christie ate them all!  #ArizonaPrimary https://t.co/Pu9Mxq7xcG
	We need to block all Muslims from coming into the United States which means Obama will have to stay in Cuba.  #Brussels #ArizonaPrimary
	Hopefully next season FX will do The People vs.Hillary Clinton.   #ThePeoplevOJSimpson
	Lindsey Graham is backing Ted Cruz, which is unusual for him since typically he prefers guys getting behind him.
	In honor of #StPatricksDay I'm going to rid America of all its snakes.  I'll start with Hillary and Obama!  @realDonaldTrump
	In a desperate attempt to fund his campaign Ted Cruz is spending #StPatricksDay trying to capture a leprechaun so he can take his gold.
	Anyone who tries to pinch me for not wearing green on #StPatricksDay will be shot by my Secret Service Detail.
	I have to admit once @marcorubio reaches puberty he will be a force to be reckoned with as a Presidential candidate!
	North Korea sentences U.S. College Student to 15 years hard labor.  The good news is he'll be in great shape for his 20 year class reunion.
	The thing I'm proudest about my Presidential campaign is the fact I never once had to go negative.  #StillSanders
	I don't think it was cool of Hillary Clinton to crash one of my rallies today.  #StillSanders https://t.co/tf95aBBLpM
	I won't close Guantanamo Bay as President as long as there's a cell big enough there to hold Rosie O'Donnell.
	I can't wait to drop the mic after I finish delivering my first State of the Union as President.
	Fox News drops #GOPDebate after I pulled out.  It's not the first time Megyn Kelly got angry at me for pulling out, but I have enough kids.
	Hey Ted Cruz if it makes you feel better, you did get the most votes for a Canadian yesterday.  You should be proud.  @realDonaldTrump
	Will it be considered racist if I have the locks changed in the White House after Obama moves out?  #SCOTUS.
	If Jared Fogle is getting attacked in prison I can only wonder what will happen to Hillary when she gets sent there.  @realDonaldTrump
	I'm surprised Obama didn't nominate Judge Reinhold for the Supreme Court.   #SCOTUS https://t.co/JYLJXCFXQi
	Disgraced Subway spokesperson Jared Fogle got pummeled so badly in prison that he looked like a protester at a Trump Rally.
	If those protesters in Chicago were mad last week at my rally, just imagine how pissed they must be after I won Illinois!  #PrimaryDay
	I was going to listen to John Kasich's victory speech but I was driving and didn't want to fall asleep at the wheel.  #PrimaryDay
	You can now stop comparing me to Hitler since he never won Florida.  #PrimaryDay #floridaprimary
	For my Vice President I'm choosing my shadow since Joe Biden proved all the job requires is to.stand behind the President and do nothing.
	I knocked Marco Rubio out of this race tonight harder than that old dude knocked out that black guy at my rally.  #floridaprimary

	If I wasn't confident that I'd win #PrimaryDay I never would have invested in this sweet coffee mug. https://t.co/awiYlgH8iQ
	Marco Rubio is resorting to his old foam party tricks to prevent my supporters from voting in Florida. #PrimaryDay https://t.co/ZRygMhgwGr
	Jeb Bush is using his old campaign bus to drive Marco Rubio voters to the polls today in Florida.  #PrimaryDay https://t.co/GQj1DtJPq4
	Just to show there are no hard feelings I'll give Marco Rubio a job in my Administration.  How does White House Gardener sound? #PrimaryDay
	If someone tries to stop you from voting for me in Florida today remember the Stand Your Ground law still applies there.  #PrimaryDay
	Stop saying #FeelTheBern!  Hillary thinks you're making fun of her husband's Gonorrhea.  #PrimaryDay
	We need another Indiana Jones film almost as much as we need another Clinton Presidency.  #PrimaryDay
	I love using Banana Boat sunblock because it reminds me of how Marco Rubio came to America.  #PrimaryDay https://t.co/BjvUXYbvCx
	I wonder which of the two old white men running for the Democratic Nomination will win #PrimaryDay.
	#JohnKasich is like the Bengals.  They're both from Ohio and no matter how hard their fans pray they're never going to win.  #PrimaryDay
	Mother Teresa was finally approved for Sainthood.  I wonder how long it will take for me to get approved.
	I don't have to beware the #IdesOfMarch since I've already been stabbed in the back by all my fellow politicians.
	Which ever reporter said the pen is mightier than the sword never got their ass kicked by my campaign manager.  @benshapiro #Breitbart
	If I was a bully like @benshapiro claims I would have taken his lunch money and stuck his head in a toilet. That's what bullies do to geeks!
	I don't know why Megyn Kelly hates me so much, I'm pretty sure I was never married to her.  #KellyFile
	For the sake of her campaign, Hillary Clinton has asked Bill to please start watching #TheBachelor with his pants on.
	I feel bad for my protesters, they have to choose between watching #BETHonors or causing havoc at my rally tonight.
	Once again I was snubbed at this year's #BETHonors.
	If we don't get this illegal immigration problem under control, pretty soon we'll have to change every state's name to New Mexico!
	The media gives me crap for selling steaks at The Sharper Image but gives @HillaryClinton a pass for selling out Americans in Benghazi.

	If I had a dollar for every time someone said Donald Trump and Hitler in the same sentence this month, I'd be a billionaire.  Oh wait, I do!

	I knew giving people in Flint my bottle water in exchange for votes would pay off.  #michiganprimary https://t.co/QM9iHN6cj4

	Obama is such a bad President that even the oil painting of Abraham Lincoln in the White House is now giving him dirty looks.
	The rumors are false. 
When I'm elected I'm not putting TRUMP on the White House in big gold letters. 
They will be small and very tasteful.
	At least now we know why #OJSimpson wouldn't let his kids get a metal detector for Christmas.
	Not only do I think #OJSimpson killed Ron and Nicole but I'm pretty sure he started the fire in the Towering Inferno https://t.co/6HCLBL9m5q
	LAPD find missing knife in #OJSimpson's backyard.  In related news Ted Cruz is a Canadian and shouldn't be allowed to run for President.
	My theory on the knife is OJ Simpson probably let the Clintons use his backyard to bury the weapons they murdered their enemies with.
	LAPD have reportedly found knife used in #OJSimpson murders. If they want a real challenge they should try finding Obama's birth certificate
	See my hands don't have any blood on them, it's too bad @HillaryClinton can't say the same thing.  #GOPDebate https://t.co/ZRjpA7tlqU
	Megyn Kelly is just angry that she was easier to get into than Trump University.   #GOPDebate
	I have to be completely objective.  I totally dominated tonight's #GOPDebate.
	Megyn Kelly needs to stop undressing me with her eyes, it's distracting.  #GOPDebate
	#johnkasich is talking, time for a bathroom break.  #GOPDebate
	Would a #MittRomneySexTape of himself masturbating be considered sodomy since it involves an asshole?
	Mitt Romney told me the reason his name is Mitt is because when he's with his boyfriend, he's catching not pitching.
	Mitt Romney admitted he shit his magic underwear when he found out I won #SuperTuesday.
	Now that Ben Carson is dropping out he can go back to performing surgery and remove Ted Cruz's head out of his ass.
	Hillary Clinton better start being much nicer to me if she wants any chance in hell of getting a Presidential Pardon when I'm elected.
	I'm old fashion on abortion. It should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest and accidentally getting your mistress pregnant #StopTheSham
	My first act as President will be turning all those secret FEMA camps into Trump Resorts for the middle class.
	This is getting embarrassing.  A bowel movement I had four hours ago received more votes in Georgia than Marco Rubio.  #SuperTuesday #trump
	I'm picking up Delegates tonight even easier than I picked up chicks back in my single days.  #SuperTuesday #Trump
	Megyn Kelly just said I sounded Presidential. Looks like someone wants me to give them a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom.  #Trump. #SuperTuesday
	Chris Christie has been standing behind ever since I put that Snickers bar in my pocket.  #Trump. #SuperTuesday https://t.co/SJbsIE00LU
	I just won Massachusetts!  How do you like them apples Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio?  #Trump #SuperTuesday
	Whether or not Hillary or myself get elected, you'll be calling one of us Mr. President.   #Trump.  #SuperTuesday
	Whoever keeps ripping down Ted Cruz signs outside people's homes please stop.  Oh wait, that was me.   #SuperTuesday
	It's #SuperTuesday which means all my haters are busy practicing their shocked face for when I win tonight.
	I knew feeding my Secret Service Detail raw meat for dinner would pay off. https://t.co/1MwdaazHKT
	Great news! I finally captured the Zodiac Killer. I'm dropping Ted Cruz off to the cops right now.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/AjfM99oGbg
	I know people are angry that Trump Mortgage got Ambassador Stevens killed.  Oh wait, that was Hillary's involvement in Benghazi.
	I'm happy #LeonardoDiCaprio won his first Oscar tonight. I loved him in Titanic which was also the nickname for Jeb Bush's campaign. #Oscars
	Did anyone else notice that no black actors were nominated tonight?  #oscars
	My favorite #Oscars drinking game is every time a winner thanks a liberal you take a shot.  Guaranteed to give you alcohol poisoning.
	I don't see what the big deal about #Revenant is. Megyn Kelly's attack on me was way more vicious than the bear attack on Leo.  #Oscars
	The #Oscars lost all credibility years ago when I wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Home Alone 2. https://t.co/Bx3oKHtqgT
	For the record I banned David Duke from all my Trump Resorts after he cut holes in all my white sheets to make KKK outfits.  #NeverTrump
	The reason it's better to live one day as a lion than a 100 years as a sheep is because Marco Rubio doesn't have sex with lions.  #Mussolini
	Just imagine, this time next year I'll have the nuclear codes.  We'll all sleep better at night then.   #NeverTrump
	Just because Ted Cruz was great as the creepy dummy in Goosebumps doesn't mean he'd be a good President. #NeverTrump https://t.co/G2TRuyvvPw
	I'm perfectly fine with this election coming down to which candidate has the hottest daughter.   #GOPDebate #NeverTrump
	A dying man's last wish was "Don't vote for Trump."  Vince Foster's dying wish was "Hillary put down the gun."   #NeverTrump
	It was very distracting at last night's #GOPDebate when Marco Rubio's Grindr app kept beeping on his phone to alert him Ted Cruz was nearby.
	Marco Rubio's only problem with Obamacare is it doesn't pay for the Flintstones Vitamins he takes every morning. https://t.co/1oCfWsFBh3
	This must have been weird for Marco Rubio.  On most nights he's the one in between two guys. #GOPDebate https://t.co/jhIgSe2enE
	I have to be completely objective. I totally dominated tonight's #GOPDebate.
	I would respect Mexico's President more for declaring he wasn't paying for my wall if he wasn't sneaking across our border when he said it.
	#WhichHillary is trending now but it is spelled wrong.  The correct spelling is #WitchHillary
	Marco Rubio needs to drop out of the race and focus  on the pact he made with his buddies to lose their virginity before this year's prom.
	To be fair I think Ted Cruz did pretty well in the Nevada primary considering he's a Canadian running for President of the United States.
	When I heard a Grand Wizard endorsed me for President I was hoping it was Harry Potter.  It turns out it was just that racist David Duke.
	Mitt Romney needs to go back to Staples and staple his slanderous mouth shut!
	Hey Mitt Romney, Paulie Walnuts called.  He wants his hairstyle back. https://t.co/B25ahethMu
	I expected better from Mitt Romney.  Us billionaires have to stick together.  Oh wait, that's right, he isn't one!  #brokeass
	Mitt Romney needs a better cologne because I can still smell the stench of failure on him from the 2012 election.
	Don't worry America as President I'm going to find a cure for Autism and Liberalism.  #Nevadacaucus https://t.co/7KZegLdezP
	I was busy swimming in my money pit, anyone know who they're projecting to win the #nevadacaucus?
	Ted Cruz is going to be so depressed after the Nevada GOP results come in that he'll end up in a brothel asking for the Lamar Odom.
	I tried to record tonight's #DemTownHall but fortunately my DVR has standards.
	For the record, I didn't start the rumor Marco Rubio had an affair.  I only wish I did!
	Jeb Bush has decided to get into art like his brother, here is his first masterpiece. https://t.co/pELOPGxEQM
	I offered Marco Rubio a good deal. If he drops out, I'll buy him a taco franchise in a food court of his choosing. https://t.co/GNekVj800R
	As President I'm getting rid of Home Depot parking lots so illegal immigrants won't have a place to hangout. https://t.co/RUJcitMrFX
	I'd like to thank my pal Bill O'Reilly for hammering Ted Cruz on his show. As promised that briefcase of cash will be at your door tomorrow.
	Hillary Clinton's cameo on #TheWalkingDead tonight was amazing. https://t.co/6zElmhrzMY
	I love how tonight's #TheWalkingDead was one big promo for Orange Crush which also happens to be my skin color.
	George W. Bush owes Jeb a lot because thanks to his disastrous campaign invading Iraq is no longer the worst Bush family debacle.
	What I'm going to miss most about Jeb Bush running is seeing him pull up to the debates in his campaign bus. https://t.co/dart0Fko3p
	I'm sorry I said Ted Cruz pees sitting down.  He told me that in confidence.
	This South Carolina primary is close. I haven't faced competition this tough since NBC put "The Apprentice" up against Desperate Housewives.
	Will Ferrell thinks Hillary Clinton will be our next President.  I always said that guy is hilarious!
	Obama to skip #ScaliaFuneral because he's too busy trying to bury America.
	To show their gratitude for Apple not helping the FBI, ISIS has agreed to release their beheading videos exclusively on iTunes.
	I love America more than I love myself.  And we all know how much I love myself!
	Yes I did go on a double date in the 90's with my good friend Michael Jackson.  I took Marla Maples and he took Macaulay Culkin.
	In 2002 I said we should go into Iraq. Big deal! I once wanted to go into Sharon Stone, but I realize that too would have been a big mistake
	Critics who attack my lack of military experience clearly don't take into account the 500+ hours I've logged playing the new Call of Duty.
	Marco Rubio has ended his campaign so he can devote his full attention to finishing puberty.
	I'm not sure how Harper Lee died, but I'm guessing she was murdered by an illegal immigrant.  Good going Obama!
	The Pope is just angry at me because every time he talks to God, God only wants to talk about how well I'm doing in the polls.
	The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.  His second greatest trick was getting Obama elected.
	Sorry lobbyists but I won't put my face on money when I'm elected President because I refuse to be in the pocket of anyone!
	I refuse to leave my wife for Nikki Haley so she gets revenge by endorsing Marco Rubio instead.
	Allah was so grateful for Tim Cook and #Apple refusing to help the FBI fight terrorism that he rewarded Steve Jobs with 72 virgins today.
	As President I'm going to undo everything Obama did, including taking down the NWA poster he hung in the Oval Office https://t.co/gJczR9Rje2
	Obama seems pissed at me today, maybe he thinks I finally found his real birth certificate.
	Obama said Mr. Trump will not be President. I don't know if that's true, but I know Mr. Obama will never be a good President.
	I can't wait until this time next year so I can finally start getting #PresidentsDay gifts.
	It's pretty sad when healthcare is better in a zombie apocalypse than it is under Obamacare. #TheWalkingDead https://t.co/H3tMeqI9X0
	Who died on tonight's #TheWalkingDead?  Hopefully it was a liberal.
	Kobe is Bill Cosby's favorite athlete. Not because he's good at basketball but because he was accused of rape and everyone forgave him.
	I haven't been this bored listening to 2 hacks since I had to pick between Arsenio and Clay Aiken on Celebrity Apprentice.  #DemDebate
	Hillary is trying to psych out Bernie by dressing like one of the politicians from The Hunger Games.  #DemDebate https://t.co/oOAroqNB2R
	The only difference between Hillary and Pinocchio is that Her nose doesn't grow when she lies and she was always born a real boy. #DemDebate
	I could have ended up like Bruce Wayne, expect my parents weren't dumb enough to walk down a dangerous alley at night.  #BatmanvSuperman
	Who am I rooting for in Batman v Superman?  The answer is the one whose parents didn't send him illegally to America as a child.
	Meryl Streep said "We're All Africans." Well that explains my extremely large penis and incredible dancing ability.
	I'm not willing to say that I'm 100% sure OJ Simpson committed those murders until I know where Obama was that night.
	I've been blasting Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust" all day long.  That song never sounded so sweet!  #CarlyFiorina #ChrisChristie
	Carly Fiorina dropped out of the Presidential race to fulfill her lifelong dream of being a Caitlyn Jenner impersonator.
	Bernie Sanders looks like he just realized his wallet is missing and Al Sharpton looks like he's not giving it back. https://t.co/moZ1QU98ab
	Chris Christie is quitting the race so he can spend more time with his family and his local Dunkin' Donuts.
	It's Ash Wednesday which means Ted Cruz is going to put the ashes of what's left of his campaign on his forehead.
	Ben Carson put the gun down!  You're taking losing New Hampshire way too hard.  #NHPrimary #ThePeoplevOJSimpson https://t.co/9WIaU3bqsP
	I'm going to be modest and predict I'll go 49-1 in State Primaries this year.  #NewHampshire
	I've been busy making love to my supermodel wife that I haven't checked the news.  Anyone know who won New Hampshire?
	I'm so sexy that Michelle Obama has asked to stay on as First Lady after I'm elected President.
	Great news!  I was just endorsed by the horse who kicked @JebBush in the head as a child. https://t.co/cnvYVPP1R0
	Jeb Bush wants to start a Twitter war with me. Hopefully it goes better for him than the 2 wars his brother started. https://t.co/1BIuoW02uf
	Hillary's campaign takes a huge hit as Bill Clinton's most recent lover announces plans to write Tell-All book. https://t.co/bx2NJjL4jB
	This is getting embarrassing.  Actress Sophia Bush is now beating Jeb Bush in latest national poll. https://t.co/WuIOhCKpfh
	I don't blame Peyton Manning for kissing Papa John after winning #SB50.  I plan on kissing him when I win the Presidency.
	I'm so rich that even my shadow has a trust fund.
	I've never been inside a Red Lobster but that's only because God loves me and made me rich.  #Trump
	Wow!  Apu from The Simpsons just endorsed Marco Rubio.  #bobbyjindal https://t.co/YK0st5HZ4o
	NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is such a shameless liar, I'm shocked the Democrats aren't running him for President.
	It's unfair that they ban Bernie Sanders supporters from Tinder, but they keep letting Marco Rubio supporters use Grindr.
	I thought I was watching the #DemDebate tonight but it turns out I was watching a rerun of Golden Girls.
	If I flirt with @andersoncooper tonight on CNN it's not because I'm gay, it's because I'm trying to make @megynkelly jealous.
	We need a wall at the northern border too so Canadian immigrants don't come into this country and steal like Ted Cruz stole the #IowaCaucus.
	In honor of Rosa Parks, @JebBush refused to sit in the back of his campaign bus today. https://t.co/XtyvDdizGL
	President Obama better take his prayer rug out of the Oval Office or I'll throw it out when I move in the White House.  #MosqueVisit
	I'm shocked Rick Santorum has dropped out of the Presidential election.  I didn't even know he was running.
	Ted Cruz better wear flame retardant clothes if the saying Liar Liar Pants On Fire is true, because he's going to burn for his voter fraud.
	Whenever I get sad I just remind myself @JebBush is still running for President. That makes me laugh every time! https://t.co/sFySBKWR68
	#RandPaul has quit the Presidential Election so he can focus on winning this year's Westminster Dog Show. https://t.co/jV3UWiJpeT

	If you want to "Turn Off Trump" it's very simple.  Just show me Hillary Clinton in a bikini.  I won't be able to get Turned On ever again!
	Punxsutawney Phil emerged from the ground today to appear in a Pennsylvania court to accuse Bill Cosby of rape. https://t.co/9F8Rjuvh9m

	I haven't come in 2nd at anything since I lost to Brad Pitt for People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1995.  #IowaCaucus https://t.co/KUHXxhlUjZ
	If Ronald Reagan was alive today he'd say "Help! They Buried Me Alive!"  Then he would say "Voters In Iowa Were Dumb Voting For Ted Cruz."
	I would send underage hookers to Ted Cruz's hotel room to destroy his campaign, but unfortunately Bill Clinton already hired them all.
	Congratulations to Ted Cruz for becoming the first Canadian ever to win the #IowaCaucus.   @realDonaldTrump
	Chris Christie today predicted an early spring.  #GroundhogDay https://t.co/cJV0mohJaL
	Hillary and Bernie are locked in a dead heat.  The only thing better would be if they were locked together underwater.  #IowaCaucus
	Hypothetically speaking #TedCruz, how big of a check would someone need to write for you to drop out of this race?   #IowaCaucus
	I lost the #IowaCaucus.  I haven't felt this bad since I accidentally watched Exit to Eden starring Rosie O'Donnell. https://t.co/cH8zABF5o3
	Winning the #IowaCaucus is like winning Celebrity Apprentice.  Yeah I pretend it's important but actually it means absolutely nothing.
	Don't get cocky #TedCruz.  Charlie Sheen bragged about "Winning!" then came down with AIDs.  #IowaCaucus
	I'm starting to think America likes voting for Presidential Candidates who weren't born in The United States.  #IowaCaucus #TedCruz
	NBC and CBS is reporting the Dummy from Goosebumps has defeated me in the #IowaCaucus.   #TedCruz https://t.co/IFKkUVse7n
	Latest update from the #IowaCaucus Democratic race has the old white man leading with 51%.  Bernie Sanders is close behind with 49%.

	The worst part of missing tonight's #GOPDebate was not getting to see Jeb Bush's campaign bus.  #Trump https://t.co/XfDRF4Xexr
	Chris Christie honored my absence at the #GOPDebate by eating dinner for two.  Never mind, he does that every night.
	I don't have time for the #GOPDebate. I'm at the White House with my interior decorator to discuss redecorating when I move in.  #Trump
	I'll be at Drake University tonight.  I was going to go to Kanye West University instead but it smells too much like Kardashians.
	I see #Barbie is trending.  It is probably because she is moderating Fox News' #GOPDebate tonight.   @realDonaldTrump
	Saying Fox News is Fair and Balanced is like saying Megyn Kelly is an Intelligent Natural Blonde.
	Bill O'Reilly did buy me a milkshake before and so did Bill Cosby but I don't remember what happened after that.  #Trump
	Bill O'Reilly asked me to be the bigger man on Fox News tonight. Clearly he's never seen me naked or he'd know I'm always the bigger man!
	How can anyone seriously consider voting for @tedcruz.  Do we really want two Presidents in a row who weren't born in America?
	Without me, the ratings for Fox News' #GOPDebate will be lower than Megyn Kelly's panties at a fraternity party.  #Trump
	Since I now have nothing to do on Thursday maybe I'll join Tinder.  Bill Clinton tells me it's the best!  #GOPDebate. #Trump

	I don't know why Megyn Kelly hates me so much.  I'm pretty sure I was never married to her.
	Megyn Kelly only hates me because I haven't been into blondes since the 90's.

	I land the John Wayne and Sarah Palin endorsement on the same day.  Only thing better would be if Jesus endorsed me, oh wait -- he just did!
	Sarah Palin officially endorses me which locks up the sexy mom with glasses vote nationwide. https://t.co/DysWochHoR
	Will it be considered racist if I have the locks changed in the White House when I move in?
	I just signed a million dollar endorsement deal with Sara Lee, since I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread. https://t.co/qgGeqZ8zCt

	I make one negative comment about Glory Holes and Lindsey Graham gets back at me by endorsing @jebbush.
	I'm not sure how Grizzly Adams died but it is probably safe to say he was murdered by an illegal immigrant.
	I have to be completely objective, I totally dominated tonight's #GOPDebate.
	The Police are the most mistreated people in this country because people are still angry for Sting quitting.  #GOPDebate
	I see that @jebbush's campaign bus has already arrived for tonight's #GOPDebate. https://t.co/lGpMB0TscR

	Carly Fiorina is getting her game face ready for tonight's #GOPDebate.  Hopefully it's more attractive than her regular face.
	You're better off buying a #Powerball ticket than donating money to Hillary's campaign because a Powerball ticket has a chance of winning.

	Sean Penn is trying to convince Al Pacino to help him break El Chapo out of prison on a boat before he kills him. https://t.co/6XXlui6MdM
	They should change the name of #Powerball to Trump since it's worth a ridiculous amount and everyone in America can't stop talking about it.
	I'd like to personally welcome #Powerball to the Billionaire Club.  It's awesome being a member.
	The good news is I'm no longer Mexican drug lord #ElChapo's #1 enemy.  That title goes to Sean Penn for accidentally getting him captured.

	I would have asked Santa to make me President for Christmas but it looks like the voters are going to do that for me.
	Merry Christmas Obama.  And unplug the tree before  bed, I don't want the White House burning down until I have a chance to move in.
	Last night I was visited by the ghosts of Christmas past, future, and present who told me to change my ways.  They were Democrats of course.
	Santa gave me the best present ever this morning, my latest poll numbers.  And yes I'm still winning!
	I'm clearing up the rumors once and for all, President  Obama does not believe in Santa.  He only believes in Allah.
	I used to leave cookies out for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve but I'm tired of Chris Christie breaking into my home to eat them.
	For my Christmas present to Obama I offered to get his birth certificate framed for him but for some reason he said no.  @realDonaldTrump
	With that terrible trade he made for #BoweBergdahl, Obama just might have what it takes to be the next GM for the Philadelphia Eagles.
	When I said Hillary got schlonged by Obama it wasn't meant literally. We all know Hillary hasn't got schlonged since Chelsea was conceived.
	After watching #MissUniverse2015 I've decided to only let in the hot female immigrants as President.
	Jeb Bush is so dumb that when I told him America needs to come together to beat ISIS he started organizing a nationwide circle jerk.

	Yes, I'm now pals with @tedcruz.  If this election doesn't work out, we're going on "The Amazing Race" together. #GOPDebate
	I feel bad having to beat up on @JebBush because Forrest Gump is my favorite movie.  #GOPDebate
	"I know what I don't know."  Is that from Jeb Bush or the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.  #GOPDebate
	#JohnKasich is talking, time for a bathroom break.  #GOPDebate
	I haven't toppled a Leader before, but I've toppled countless blondes in my younger days if you know what I mean.  #GOPDebate
	I'm pretty sure Ben Carson came up with his Syrian plan after playing with his G.I. Joe Action Figures last night.  #GOPDebate
	Okay #CarlyFiorina I'll ask a woman, do you know any?  #GOPDebate
	Marco Rubio is going to be an unbeatable candidate once he goes through puberty.  #GOPDebate
	I wouldn't bomb ISIS, I'd put #CarlyFiorina in charge of them.  She'd run them into the ground like she did with Hewlett Packard. #GOPDebate
	Jeb's brother could barely finish a children's book on 9/11, it's not surprising he couldn't finish 2 Wars.  #GOPDebate
	This #GOPDebate is so boring.  Just wake me up when I'm elected President.
	Jeb Bush seems really pissed off tonight, he must have seen his latest poll numbers.  #GOPDebate
	I gave myself chills with my opening statement.  #GOPDebate
	Jeb Bush just asked if we can sing the Mexican National Anthem next for his wife in the crowd.  #GOPDebate
	Chris Christie's back at the main #GOPDebate.  At least that explains what happened to all the snacks in the green room.
	Who let that annoying poodle backstage before the #GOPDebate?  Oh wait, that's just Rand Paul.
	Thanks Lindsey Graham but I don't think the #GOPDebate is the proper venue to guess how big my penis is. https://t.co/SFy9PPZHMp
	I see @JebBush's campaign bus has already arrived at the #GOPDebate. https://t.co/DvhQhagXGQ
	Who's winning the early #GOPDebate?  Better question, who cares?
	To celebrate the release of #StarWarsForceAwakens Carly Fiorina is skipping her wax before tonight's #GOPDebate so she can go as Chewbacca.
	Hillary Clinton made out her letter to Santa today and once again a Pardon was on the top of her Christmas wish list.
	My Sources tell me Marco Rubio is currently in the Boys' Department at Sears picking out a new suit for tonight's #GOPDebate.
	I'm excited for tonight's #GOPDebate mainly to find out who hasn't dropped out yet.
	Muslim terrorists set off bomb in Kabul.  If only we had a candidate willing to take them on.  Oh wait, we do --ME!!!!!    #trump
	Here's a great photo of Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin meeting an American Treasure.    #trump https://t.co/HMqOimPCNc
	I'm not worried about beating @HillaryClinton.  After Muslims see the Mohammed cartoon that I signed her name to, they'll beat her for me.
	Someone needs to take the Elf off the Shelf, otherwise @greggutfeld will never be able to get down on his own and film his show today.
	El Chapo couldn't even win his war against me, what makes him think he can defeat ISIS?
	The #DemDebate was robbed of a #GoldenGlobe nomination for Best Comedy Series.
	I'm starting a Muslim Suicide Hotline so they'll know there are other ways to kill yourself that doesn't involve blowing up innocent people.
	Despite rumors, I love the bald eagle that attacked me during my Time photoshoot.  That's why I had him stuffed and put on my wall.  #Trump
	I just hit 40k followers.  Thanks for the support and for helping Make America Great Again.   @realDonaldTrump
	Jeb Bush had a terrible nightmare that next week's #GOPDebate was changed to a Spelling Bee at the last minute.
	I have to avoid visiting Fox News until after the holidays because batshit crazy @megynkelly keeps trying to trap me under the mistletoe.
	It's not surprising Muslims love Hillary Clinton. Her face is their best argument for why women should be covered up https://t.co/BlQC4pdg2H
	Wow!  It turns out England hates me more than dental hygiene.  I didn't think that was possible.  #Trump
	Of course Hillary doesn't want to bar Muslims from entering the U.S.  She didn't even care when they entered our embassy in Benghazi.
	If we spent the time monitoring Muslims' Internet activity as we did blondes #SanBernadino wouldn't have happened! https://t.co/1db71a1Sy6
	I'm being interviewed tonight by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters. She reminds me of a female version of Hillary Clinton.
	When I'm elected President I'm getting rid of Air Force One because my Jet is better!  #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty https://t.co/k657yjQ6EA
	My sex appeal is so strong that Michelle Obama said when I'm elected she's going to ask to stay on as First Lady. #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty
	A new poll reveals I have enough support from branches of the Armed Forces to remove Obama from the White House with a military coup. #Trump
	Actually WH Press Secretary what disqualifies you from running is not being born in the U.S.  Where is your boss' Birth Certificate again?
	Nothing sums up Obama's twisted White House like his Press Secretary saying I'm disqualified from running for using my 1st Amendment right.
	Liberals and my GOP opponents are now calling my plan to keep raccoons out of trash cans racist and unconstitutional https://t.co/xZj5GCGr2W
	I'm going to be elected President, the sooner everyone accepts that the sooner we can start the healing process.  #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty
	Does Amazon accept EBT Cards?  If it does Liberals should use theirs to buy my book Crippled America.  It might wake them up.
	I should have bought stock in Haterade because there sure are a lot of assholes on Twitter drinking it today.  #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty
	I almost didn't hear that #TrumpIsDisqualifiedParty was trending because the sound of China and Iran laughing at America was so loud.
	Lots of negativity aimed at me today. If I didn't have 10 billion dollars and wasn't leading in the polls I might be depressed. #TrumpOnCNN
	Wow, what a morning!  Lindsey Graham doesn't know how lucky he is that no one knows he's running for President.   #TrumpOnCNN
	If the press is going to compare anyone to Hitler it should be @HillaryClinton.  She can grow a much better mustache than me.   #TrumpOnCNN
	How can I be racist when my best friend is Black?  #TrumpOnCNN #trump https://t.co/hkMAXvclcy
	Instead of barring me, Florida should have barred Muslim terrorists looking to take flight lessons.  #TrumpOnCNN #trump
	Philadelphia Daily News compared me to Hitler.  I've seen toilet paper with more substance than that sorry excuse for journalism.  #trump
	After hearing my ban on Muslims Obama immediately asked "But how will I get back into the country when I travel abroad?"  #Trump
	To make sure no Muslims try getting around my ban everyone will have to eat a pork sandwich before entering the U.S. https://t.co/cU7rQ7Jzdn
	I'm not afraid how Muslims will react to me banning them as President because they're so calm and rational.   #Trump
	I will still go out for sushi tonight, but in honor of #PearlHarbor I won't tip my Japanese waiter.
	Obama really inspired me tonight with his speech.  He inspired me to get up and turn off the television.  #ObamaSpeech
	It's not surprising liberals who won't even call December 25th Christmas refuse to call Islamic extremists killing 14 people terrorism.
	#SanBernadino massacre pretty much destroyed my critics' argument that Muslim women raise no potential threat to Americans.  #SyrianRefugees
	Dick Cheney is trending.  Hopefully it's because he took @JebBush hunting.
	Obama's Presidency has screwed more African-Americans than the Kardashians have.  #TeamTrump
	Ever since I signed Lindsey Graham up for Grindr he hasn't stopped smiling.  #RJCForum https://t.co/EnEu1JFnsT
	I haven't used a pen on a woman since Megyn Kelly asked me to draw her Tramp Stamp. https://t.co/50eoESyqNa
	When Chris Christie heard Sandy Berger was trending he hurried to the beach in New Jersey thinking someone dropped their Big Mac.
	Somehow I pissed off some woman at the Washington Post named Dana @Milbank who is now calling me a racist and a bigot.
	This is a photo I took of a Muslim celebrating on 9/11 by doing backflips.  I accept your apologize liberal media. https://t.co/qjdYNKZ1kv
	Big deal #MarkZuckerberg.  I've given a fortune to Charity over the years.  And yes, Charity is the name of my favorite stripper.
	The creepiest thing about this photo is @JohnKasich was staring at me while he was sucking on that. https://t.co/Mf0yZF3k16
	Chris Chrisitie is lying about Muslims celebrating on 9/11 just like he's lying about who ate all the donuts. https://t.co/9eXW5dxatm
	Jeb Bush is celebrating the 60th anniversary of Rosa Parks by refusing to sit in the back of his own campaign bus. https://t.co/kR0eFOLzUx
	I stumped over 100 black pastors today with the question "If God exists then why'd he create Hillary Clinton?" https://t.co/W98yXMpegP
	Who am I rooting for in #BatmanvSuperman?  I'll give you a hint, it's the one whose parents didn't illegally ship him to America.
	Not only did Muslims celebrate after 9/11 but I saw them cheering when the White House blew up in Independence Day. https://t.co/0I385JgPeP
	I'm trying to convince Chuck Todd that Red Bull really does give you wings so he'll drink one and jump off a building.
	Is it just me or does Chuck Todd remind you of a 7th Grader struggling to grow facial hair. https://t.co/4CE6aajbd8
	I cheered Tom Brady up after tonight's #Broncos loss by telling him that Hillary still thinks she can beat me. https://t.co/3rDM1rJ1Ip
	I'm prepping for my Monday meeting with several African-American pastors by binge watching old episodes of Amen. https://t.co/8CAQo5LHip
	Chip Kelly is so incompetent I'm shocked the Democrats aren't running him for President.  #LionsEagles #Eagles
	To prove how much I believe #BlackLivesMatter I'm in Harlem giving out free Jive Turkeys for #Thanksgiving. https://t.co/ZfLdYCjrBM
	Yes I was shooting a BB gun at the floats during today's #MacysParade.  That's what they get for messing with Trump! https://t.co/rPrmtGAml8
	If you want to mess with Ben Carson on Thanksgiving just wrap a belt buckle around the turkey when he starts to carve it.  @realDonaldTrump
	Good going Obama!  The Turkey he pardoned last #Thanksgiving has reportedly joined ISIS. https://t.co/tBR6xG7muE
	A new poll reveals "Trump Running For President" is the number one thing people are thankful for this #Thanksgiving.
	Johnny Manziel is such a terrible leader he should have the name Obama on the back of his jersey.
	It was so nice of Hillary Clinton to travel to Boulder today to fill in as the University of Colorado's mascot. https://t.co/UMC8MBvjRj
	In honor of Black Friday I won't insult Obama or Ben Carson nearly as much as I do on normal days.
	Russia should have known better.  Turkey is always on edge around #Thanksgiving.
	Calm down people!  I'm hiring the same guy to do my Muslim database that Obama hired to do the Obamacare website, which means it won't work.
	If it makes everyone feel better I want a Scientologist database too.  I trust those creepy bastards even less than Muslims.
	To prove how generous I am every Muslim I register as President will get a free 9-11 coffee mug. https://t.co/F5dggTaGdo
	When I heard Barbara Walters wanted to interview me tonight I thought I'd have to use a Ouija Board.  But it turns out she's still alive!
	Rosie O'Donnell has been awfully quiet lately, I'm guessing it's because she still has food in her mouth.
	I programmed my TiVo to record #Scandal tonight but instead it recorded Hillary Clinton's latest interview.  Honest mistake.
	Yes I'll be starting a Muslim database when I'm elected President and the first name I'm adding is Barack Obama.
	It's too bad ISIS suicide bombers don't realize Lindsey Graham is one of the 72 virgins they get in paradise. https://t.co/qt7l7ZXeYC
	I'm perfectly fine with this election coming down to who has the hottest daughter.   @realDonaldTrump
	If Obama isn't a Muslim then why is he so concerned which direction Mecca is when it's time to pray?  #refugeeswelcome
	If we were in an episode of Scooby Doo we'd rip off Obama's mask and discover it's been Osama bin Laden this entire time.  #SyrianRefugees
	5 Syrians caught trying to sneak into U.S. with fake passports.  I bet my wall sounds pretty damn good right about now.
	I've got a big day ahead trying to convince the 2 people who supported Bobby Jindal to vote for me instead.
	I am shocked Bobby Jindal ended his Presidential campaign today.  I thought he ended it months ago.
	After telling the #SyrianRefugees that they'd be relocated to Detroit and Chicago they said no thanks it's safer back home.
	I've decided to make my shadow my Vice President since Joe Biden proved all the job requires is to stand behind the POTUS and do nothing.
	Hillary Clinton is such a sociopath she even lies when she talks in her sleep.
	Islam is a peaceful religion, which probably explains what attracted Ice Cube and Mike Tyson to it.
	Charlie Sheen revealed he decided to get tested when he learned he had sex with a woman who slept with Bill Clinton.
	Obama bringing in countless #SyrianRefugees is the National Security equivalent of having sex with Charlie Sheen without a condom.
	I don't know how Charlie Sheen got HIV, but my guess is that it had something to do with Obamacare.
	Obama made a compromise on the Syrian Refugees.  They can still come to America but they have to pinky swear they're not part of ISIS first.
	Ronda Rousey got some sense knocked into her last night.  She's now voting for Trump.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/D7Y9r5FlVC
	Fixing America will be tough, but I bet Ben Carson will take a stab at it.
	I'm not going to shutdown every Mosque when I'm elected. I'll keep a few open so the FBI has something to stakeout.
	Hopefully the next #DemDebate will be one long moment of silence.  It would definitely cut down on the lies. https://t.co/tXcg8D54rR
	I wonder if Obama still thinks Climate Change is our biggest threat?  #Paris  @realDonaldTrump
	I tried to read the Koran once but the Muslim who owned it before me carved out the inside of it to hide a weapon.
	As President I'm setting up Muhammad Cartoon Contests around the clock and when ISIS shows up to wreak havoc we kill them. #Paris
	When I'm elected President I'm going to annihilate #ISIS so badly their new name will be WASWAS!   #Paris
	Does the 250,000 Syrian Refugees still sound like a good idea?  #Paris
	Notice the same defense of Muslims is used for Great White Sharks.  Not all are bad just the ones who brutally kill innocent people.  #Paris
	Does anyone know what religion Jihadi John belonged to?  I'm guessing Scientology or Southern Baptist. https://t.co/SdhubglcOY
	What I'll remember most about Jihadi John is how he was so insecure about his weight that he always wore black. https://t.co/mbKWLApMZs
	It's Friday the 13th which means Ben Carson will probably wear his hockey mask and stab horny teens in the woods. https://t.co/7wvXecf49V
	I've set up speakers at the border to blast Pink Floyd's The Wall to give Mexico a taste of what's coming when I'm elected.
	Hillary's campaign has asked in lieu of cash donations send cartons of cigarettes that she can use as currency in prison.  @realDonaldTrump
	Knock, knock.
Who's there?
It's the FBI Hillary, open up! We have a warrant for your arrest.
	I'm not waiting anymore to Make America Great Again. Tonight Ted Cruz and I are lining the border with bear traps. https://t.co/9CVUGb2nMl
	Hillary Clinton respects our veterans even less than Brian Dennehy's character in the first Rambo.  #VeteransDay https://t.co/GJi4Oyn2fb
	Critics who claim it's hard to round up illegal immigrants clearly have never pulled into a Home Depot in a truck. They practically jump in!
	Bob Dole just endorsed Bush for President which isn't surprising considering he thinks the year is 1988.
	I have to be completely objective, I totally dominated tonight's #GOPDebate.
	Jeb Bush stop reading off cue cards your parents are holding up in the audience.  #GOPDebate
	Hillary Clinton would be watching the #GOPDebate but tonight is when her witch coven meets.
	I almost said Polo when Rand Paul was yelling "Marco Marco."   #GOPDebate
	Ted Cruz I loved you in Goosebumps.  #GOPDebate https://t.co/UcN8H4HHlI
	Maybe they should use a dog whistle to get #CarlyFiorina to stop talking.  #GOPDebate
	Relax Jeb, you can always visit your wife in Mexico when I send her back.  #GOPDebate
	I never thought I'd use the words "You should let Jeb speak."  #GOPDebate
	#johnkasich is talking, time for a bathroom break.  #GOPDebate
	What is #CaitlynJenner doing at tonight's #GOPDebate?   My bad, it's just #CarlyFiorina. https://t.co/SWyuOfcyGP
	Jeb Bush's campaign bus has arrived at the #GOPDebate. https://t.co/xsOODdPMKP
	Ben Carson is asking Fox if it's okay if he uses his lucky hammer tonight during the #GOPDebate.
	Hey @GovMikeHuckabee and @ChrisChristie do you guys want to carpool to tonight's main #foxbusinessdebate? Oh wait, you weren't invited.
	President Obama is so silly.  He accidentally joined Facebook today after confusing it with an ISIS recruiting website.
	I can tell by this photo Rand Paul already has his game face on for tomorrow night's #GOPDebate.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LTbWKYths1
	I'm sure @JebBush would kill Baby Hitler, but I doubt it would be as fun to watch as witnessing him kill his own campaign.
	Ben Carson became a surgeon because it was the only way he could cut people with a knife and not go to jail.  @realdonaldtrump
	Hillary hates Asians which is evident by her lack of concern about whether Glenn is alive or dead.  #TheWalkingDead https://t.co/ZiIdl35DCe
	At least I did a better job hosting #SNL tonight than Hillary did protecting our ambassadors as Secretary of State. #SNLTrumpTweetParty
	We need an intervention for Chris Christie after he showed up shit-faced on #SNL tonight. #SNLTrumpTweetParty https://t.co/bItW54Jn5A
	Larry David called me a racist and I called his ex-wife to see if Al Gore was still banging her.  #SNLTrumpTweetParty  #SNL #
	Bobby Jindal and Carly Fiorina have agreed to play Clock Boy and Caitlynn Jenner in a sketch I wrote for my #SNL appearance tonight.
	Lorne Michaels has pulled my #SNL sketch where I team up with gang from Scooby Doo to solve the mystery of Obama's missing birth certificate
	My #SNL opening monologue will be me reading Obama's plan for Syria. That will guarantee some laughs!
	Ben Carson said he's not going to watch me tonight on #SNL but that's probably just another lie.
	My favorite sketch for tomorrow night's #SNL is when I play the ghost of Vince Foster and haunt @HillaryClinton for murdering me.
	In my humble opinion my appearance on #SNL will have better ratings than the last 4 Super Bowls combined. https://t.co/AwIk3ntTlE
	Everyone give #GregHardy a break.  He's on the Dallas #Cowboys now, I think that's punishment enough.
	Now that I think of it, I've never actually seen Ben Carson's birth certificate either.  #WestPoint
	If we want President Obama to approve the #KeystoneXL we should just paint #cheguevara on it. https://t.co/AnA70HprFA
	Alec Baldwin and Adam Sandler will appear when I host #SNL in a sketch called "Marco Rubio's Boy Scout Memories." https://t.co/WmvacTNlUq
	Ben Carson admits he's not actually a brain surgeon but he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.
	It turns out Ben Carson not only lied about West Point but he also lied about being a rice mogul. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/CPJSIkPCZP
	Thank God Chris Christie and Huckabee got dumped from the #GOPDebate.  I might finally get to try the nachos at the snack table backstage.
	Latino Activists will pay audience members $5,000 for calling me a racist on #SNL.  That's hilarious, like Latino Activists have 5 grand.
	Ben Carson doesn't need a Secret Service detail.  If someone tries to hurt him he can just start talking and they'll be asleep in seconds.
	Hopefully in Bush 41's new book he'll finally reveal whether it was Barbara or him who dropped Jeb on his head as a child.
	Hey @JebBush describe with your hands how big of a failure your campaign has been.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/IKQ1YIeAjW
	The rumors are true! Chris Christie and I will be recreating the Farley-Swayze Chippendale skit when I host #SNL. https://t.co/kfihD2ROfH
	Jeb Bush tell your wife's nephew that giving the middle finger is very disrespectful.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/0O6IkyEW7E
	Oh no @JohnLeguizamo won't watch SNL because of me.  Well I won't watch him films because I don't watch movies that go straight-to-DVD.
	Has anyone seen my credit card?  I sure hope Marco Rubio doesn't have it.
	Marco Rubio has suspended his campaign so he can finish going through puberty.   @realDonaldTrump
	I'm so confident I'll win the Latino vote that I've been practicing saying "Muchas Gracias" in the mirror.
	Buy 2 copies of my new book #CrippledAmerica.  One to read and the other to throw at the first liberal you see! https://t.co/OrYTW3vDPl
	In honor of #NationalSandwichDay Jared from Subway's cellmate will only sodomize him once today. https://t.co/k8CN3Tqa0N
	Can't decide whether I should watch #TheView today or the stray cats fighting in the alley behind my building.  @AnnCoulter
	It's #ElectionDay which means Democrats will be busy picking up illegals at Home Depot and taking them to vote. https://t.co/SQoY5D6i0D
	Part of my #GOPDebate negotiations with the networks include replacing Jeb and Rand Paul with inflatable dancers. https://t.co/ac6k9wOMjg
	I believe Ben Carson is leading in the polls almost as much as I believe #JebCanFixIt.  @realDonaldTrump
	I hope billionaire Paul Singer kept his receipt when he bought Marco Rubio because he's going to want his money back when he sees the polls.
	Evidently @JebBush is starting the 'Jeb Can Fix It' Tour because the 'Jeb Can Spell It' Tour was deemed false advertising. @realdonaldtrump
	I see the Vatican is trending.  I guess they finally approved the exorcism for @HillaryClinton.
	I didn't realize how much Ben Carson wanted to be President until we were bobbing for apples on Halloween and he held my head under water.
	The best way to teach a child about Socialism is to take half their Halloween candy and give it to a kid too lazy to Trick or Treat.
	Now that #TheWalkingDead has revealed Morgan's mysterious backstory, hopefully they can shed some light on Obama's. https://t.co/BCiMiXQejN
	I could have been a National Debate Champ in college like Ted Cruz, but I chose to get laid instead.
	I'm reading Jeb Bush's Campaign Blueprint.  Mostly it's just different designs for the tree house he wants to build.  @realDonaldTrump
	Planned Parenthood hates Trick or Treaters.  It reminds them of business they didn't get. #realdonaldtrump
	I sent @HillaryClinton some kittens from Uber for #NationalCatDay.  Hopefully she treats them better than she treated our men in Benghazi.
	Originally NBC wanted to have Fear Factor's Joe Rogan moderate the #CNBCGOPDebate and make us eat pig testicles and get bit by insects.
	The latest poll following tonight's #CNBCGOPDebate reveals there are now more Bill Cosby accusers than people willing to vote for @JebBush.
	People were shocked by the moderators' behavior during the #CNBCGOPDebate. They were even more shocked there's a channel called CNBC.
	If tonight's moderators were any more incompetent the Democrats would have them running for President.  #CNBCGOPDebate @realDonaldTrump
	I used to carry a gun but I stopped after spending so much time with Rubio, Jeb, and Rand Paul so I wouldn't shoot myself.  #CNBCGOPDebate
	I have to be completely objective, I totally dominated the #GOPDebate.
	To answer your question Jeb, yes my tie was made in Mexico.  You should know, your wife made it.  @gopdebate
	I can't tell if Jeb is constipated or just really thinking hard about a good comeback for Marco Rubio.  #CNBCGOPDebate #GOPDebate
	Jeb Bush going after Marco Rubio tonight.  Reminds of when @JimCarrey and Jeff Daniels got in that fight  in Dumb and Dumber.  #GOPDebate
	Halloween isn't for a few more days so why is #CarlyFiorina wearing her #CaitlynJenner costume tonight?  #GOPDebate
	I've painted eye balls on my eyelids so I can nap when #johnkasich is talking tonight.  #GOPDebate
	Mexico is making it mandatory for all kids to climb the rope in gym class so they can scale my wall when I'm elected.  #GOPDebate
	Lindsey Graham there's not enough alcohol in this world to get someone to actually vote for you.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/nLOPf2YJOi
	My favorite new bathroom book is @greggutfeld's How to be Right.  It's perfect when you run out of toilet paper. https://t.co/9k1xvCi5VT
	I see @GregGutfeld went all out on his costume at this year's Fox News Halloween Party.   @RWSurferGirl https://t.co/drrF5C1Axj
	Jeb Bush tried to top my @MikeTyson endorsement but this is the only Boxer he could find to support his campaign. https://t.co/K3dGF3QMRr
	Thank you @MikeTyson for endorsing me for President.  And thanks for offering to bite Ben Carson for me.  I might take you up on that!
	Despite recent tension Ben Carson and I are still going together as Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson for Halloween. https://t.co/1CYPqEsz50
	Jeb Bush wants to know if they're charging for parking at tomorrow's #GOPDebate because if they are he can't afford to go. @MichaelCohen212
	The best thing about running for President is that it has really helped me overcome my shyness.
	I'm not going to shutdown every Mosque when I'm elected.  I'll keep a few open so the FBI has something to stakeout.
	I told Obama he should go as the Constitution for Halloween but he said he has no idea what that costume would look like.
	Not to take anything away from Ben Carson, but Rand Paul is also a doctor so how hard can it truly be?
	Jeb Bush's latest round of campaign fundraising went better than expected.  @realdonaldtrump https://t.co/umY3lqwqiQ
	My supporters in Iowa need to stop lying to the polls.  Yeah it's funny to get Ben Carson's hopes up but it's also a little cruel.
	People are giving me crap for my Dad giving me a $1 million loan.  That amount barely even buys you a Democratic Presidential candidate.
	Yes, when I'm elected I will deport #Supergirl who came to this country illegally.  And she better not even think about flying over my wall!
	Jeb Bush finally understands what Hillary meant when she said these things called emails are really confusing. https://t.co/ljGbxjUE9S
	Come on Bill Clinton, the cake with the nail file is for Hillary's next birthday.  @RealJamesWoods https://t.co/Xyx46qki4r
	Hillary made a wish as she blew out her birthday candles, then asked "Is Trump still running?"  @realdonaldtrump
	It's @HillaryClinton's birthday.  What do you get the girl who has everything?  Maybe a soul.
	Happy birthday @HillaryClinton.  You only turn 80 once so I hope you enjoy your special day.
	Hypothetically Ben Carson, if a suitcase filled with $25 million showed up on your doorstep, would you drop out?  Just wondering...
	So I inherited millions of dollars from my father.  Would you have rather I inherited socialist ideology like Obama did from his dad.
	I stopped Ford from moving thousands of jobs to Mexico.  What did you do today Ben Carson?  @realdonaldtrump
	If Ben Carson is a brain surgeon then why did I just walk in on him holding Marco Rubio's testicles as he told him to cough?
	It's a shame @RealJamesWoods didn't get more acclaim for his portrayal of @HillaryClinton in Disney's Hercules. https://t.co/BMW1pmogT3
	I'm going to swim some laps in my money pit before I watch Brady destroy the Jets. It's important to exercise! https://t.co/3zLOriRVyN

	Bernie Sanders' supporters please stop saying #FeelTheBern.  Bill Clinton thinks you're mocking his gonorrhea. https://t.co/LShhxDMBIL
	The best part of dinner with a room full of Democrats is when the bill comes they all pull out their EBT cards and offer to pay. #IDPJJ
	Bernie Sanders did well at tonight's Iowa Dinner except when he got confused and yelled out "BINGO" 14 times.   #IDPJJ
	Jeb Bush just pulled out all this teeth and put them under his pillow in a last ditch effort for the Tooth Fairy to finance his campaign.
	I can't tell if this photo is from a theater playing Vin Diesel's #LastWitchHunter or a #JohnKasich campaign rally. https://t.co/gzJFRlXtHD
	Jeb Bush just signed an endorsement deal with Everlast because he makes such a good punching bag.  @realdonaldtrump https://t.co/Z0WGjBZtJv
	Don't say the word Troll @mtaibbi, Carly Fiorina will think you're commenting on her looks.
	In an effort to raise money, @JebBush has decided to sell his campaign bus. https://t.co/PZt9RPNNt7
	Common Core math problem: A candidate raises $100 million but can't afford to pay his staff. How much money did @jebbush blow through?
	Jeb Bush told staffers he can't afford to pay them, but they can laugh at him for free.
	Despite the rumors I didn't cause #HurricanePatricia to hit Mexico.  I've only used my weather machine to rain on Jeb Bush's parade.
	Pete Rose bet me $10,000 he could start trending on Twitter. That son-of-a-bitch hustled me! https://t.co/vgkeCVjj34
	I just learned @Cher called me a giant today.  I wonder when she saw me naked.
	Everyone on Twitter leave Baby Hitler alone.  He didn't become anti-Semitic until the terrible 2s.
	Smile if you were actually born in the United States!  #grumpycat. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/XbYBMiFlzp
	We need my wall at the border ASAP before Hurricane #Patricia blows millions of more illegals into the United States.
	Sorry @RandPaul about your car, but that's what happens when you try to stop the Trump Train.  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/1VkoxNhZVi
	@realDonaldTrump And remember, kids will be there, so no throwing panties on stage.  I mean it Lindsey Graham!
	@realDonaldTrump  If you see a hat or shirt misspelled, then you know it's Jeb Bush's campaign selling them.
	Now that Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee are gone, all Hillary needs to get rid of Martin O'Malley is for him to drive in Baltimore after dark.
	Good job @HillaryClinton holding your ground yesterday.  Too bad you didn't give our guys in #Benghazi the support so they could have too.
	I wonder how many Tinder dates Bill Clinton managed to squeeze in yesterday during Hillary's #BenghaziCommittee Hearing testimony?
	Realizing Climate Change is our biggest threat Obama has replaced all soldiers' bullets and Kevlar with sunblock and battery operated fans.
	Lincoln Chafee has ended his Presidential campaign which frees him up to be Jim Webb's partner on this season of The Amazing Race.
	Hillary thought she did great testifying at the #Benghazi hearing until her mirror at home told her otherwise. https://t.co/ZfeKMP5wbx
	Hillary Clinton reminds me of what would happen if all the evil characters @RealJamesWoods has played had a baby who wore ugly pantsuits.
	I hope the #Benghazi hearing ends with Vin Diesel storming in as his Last Witch Hunter character and finishing @HillaryClinton off.
	I think Hillary has aged 5 years during this #Benghazi hearing.  She now looks 90.   @RogerJStoneJr https://t.co/35CV9Cf36r
	It was fitting @HillaryClinton dressed for a funeral since any chance she had of beating me just died.  #Benghazi https://t.co/sRUDFToCOI

https://t.co/4I7u0oCdjk
	If you think Hillary looked uncomfortable at today's #benghazihearings wait until she hears I'm having Vince Foster exhumed. @RogerJStoneJr
	Hillary: Yes I had Chris Stevens in my Ambassador Death Pool, but it was just a lucky coincidence. #BenghaziHearings https://t.co/8xETSQpBmY
	Hillary: Chris Stevens knew the dangers in Libya.  He also knew the dangers of crossing me.  #BenghaziHearings https://t.co/qBOE7ePiiT
	Trey Gowdy: How do you sleep at night?  
Hillary: In a coffin or upside down on the ceiling.

	The best way to know if Hillary is lying is by watching to see if her lips are moving.   #benghazicommittee
	Proving that #BlackLivesMatter @BernieSanders has suspended his campaign until Hakeem is returned safely.  #Empire https://t.co/52WnsjutTm
	As Governor @JebBush passed a law that every Florida Men's Room had to have this sign after he learned the hard way. https://t.co/AVBz3TnIdN
	Don't play the #Benghazi Hearing Drinking Game where you take a shot every time Hillary lies, because you will die of alcohol poisoning!
	Joe Biden isn't running.  Hillary spent all that time writing a suicide note in his handwriting and finding a spot in the woods for nothing.
	Good for Khloe Kardashian for reuniting with her husband Lamar Odom after his whorehouse bender.   Hillary Clinton would be proud!
	Bernie Sanders hasn't heard the news about Joe Biden yet, his AOL dial-up connection is super slow this morning.
	Hillary, Joe Biden lived up to his part of the deal by announcing he's not running. Now release his wife and grandchildren like you promised
	Is that a hyena in heat?  Never mind it's just the sound of Hillary cackling after hearing Joe Biden won't be running for President.
	That was nice of Carly Fiorina to visit Lamar Odom in the hospital.  But why did she say she's his ex father-in-law? https://t.co/Z4ljlafpqT
	Jimmy Kimmel is really pissed at me for canceling last night.  I hope I didn't just blow my one big chance to get on network TV.
	To prove she has nothing to hide Hillary Clinton is going to wear a see-through pantsuit at tomorrow's Benghazi hearing.
	Hillary still thinks the Libyan Terrorists killed Doc Brown because of a YouTube video.  #BacktotheFuture https://t.co/tCMvJcQZCh
	Rumor is the first thing Lamar Odom said after waking up was "Did Trump Make America Great Again Yet?"  Not yet Lamar but I'm working on it!

	I haven't taken on such weak competition since ABC put Cougar Town up against The Apprentice. https://t.co/WKyxDWXmkR
	Luckily Ben Carson isn't behind @JebBush in the polls.  Jeb still has nightmares from the time a Black Guy was behind him at an ATM.
	Carly Fiorina dropped in the new CNN poll worse than Hewlett Packard stock did when she was in charge.
	In Joe Biden's defense he yelled kill that evil bastard while watching the Bin Laden raid, but everyone assumed he was talking about Hillary
	So sweet!  Rand Paul and his wife went on a romantic stroll to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. https://t.co/0hgubeA8aK
	The only reason I canceled my appearance on @jimmykimmel was because they wanted me to read Mean Tweets but they couldn't find any about me.
	Fun fact - Bill Clinton recreated this famous Kennedy photo with Monica under the desk.   @rwsurfergirl https://t.co/5iyuoiVbSC
	Hillary Clinton will do anything to win the nomination. She just threw a grenade at Jim Webb and told him @BernieSanders did it.
	That Muslim Clock Boy is up to something.  When he met Obama at the White House today he asked for enriched uranium for his next project.
	Jim Webb's campaign was over the moment he admitted he only killed one man.  Democrats want a candidate with multiple kills like Hillary.
	Anyone else think Ben Carson and I look like dead-ringers for Danny Glover and Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon? https://t.co/8xs28m2mQF

	Obama is now claiming America has no homeless problem, just millions of people who are camping out for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
	I've shamed @jebbush so much over 9/11 that he's decided to now run under his mother's maiden name.    @realDonaldTrump
	I just ordered a pizza to Hillary's and paid the delivery driver $50 to say "FBI we have a warrant for your arrest" as he knocks on her door

	Now that Anthony Mackie is endorsing me, the next Avenger I'm going to try to win over is the Hulk. Won't be easy @Rosie O'Donnell hates me.
	Since bragging about his brother's job on 9/11 isn't working, maybe Jeb should talk about how well he did with Katrina. @realDonaldTrump

	Well Jeb if we're bringing up NBC reality shows, your campaign is clearly The Biggest Loser!  @realdonaldtrump  
 https://t.co/xVU7PwMbbS
	Barbara Bush told me when Jeb has this look on his face, he's daydreaming of rabbits running in the field again. http://t.co/jo0iXPtq35
	Sorry Jeb, you left me no choice but to criticize your brother's failure on 9/11 because you brag about that day more than Al-Qaeda.
	And yes my Secret Service detail will be armed with Elephant Guns just in case I have another confrontation with @Rosie O'Donnell.
	Larry David was so convincing as Bernie Sanders on #SNL that he was attacked by #BlackLivesMatter activists after the show.
	If Hillary got elected we'd have to change the name of Air Force One to Con Air.
	Bernie Sanders can't even afford a good suit, so how is he going to afford to give everyone free college and health care?
	George Bush stole his Mission Accomplished line from Jeb who said it when he quit school after finishing 10th grade. http://t.co/3PSCYsR0Ug
	The only bad part of being in Massachusetts tonight is every time someone says Wicked, I think they're warning me Hillary is behind me.

	Obama is hosting the first meeting of his Community of Nations tonight, but doesn't know how much pizza to order since no one has RSVP'd.
	So it looks like the only soldier Obama is willing to bring home from Afghanistan is that traitor Bowe Bergdahl.   @realdonaldtrump
	Jeb Bush is so dumb that he's still only halfway through that children's book his brother George was reading on 9/11.
	Bill Clinton was going to ask the first #DemDebate question, but "Is it Safe to back on Ashley Madison yet?" wasn't appropriate.
	Actually Obama we're going to need those troops back from Afghanistan to fight the 250,000 Syrian Refugees you're letting come to America.
	No it's not me lowering my shoulder into Marco Rubio, it's just London Mayor Boris Johnson beating up a 10 year old. http://t.co/bFTmHdHbGE
	In Hillary's defense of course she thinks the email scandal is trivial. Especially compared to  the other sinister illegal shit she's done.

	Transcript from #DemDebate After Party.  
Jim Webb: "How'd I do tonight?" 
Hillary: "You did great, Jim!"  
Jim Webb: "Wow, you are a liar!"
	I should have Secret Service protection!  But they're probably too busy chasing whores or trying to bring down Obama's political enemies.
	Good luck today Marco Rubio taking your PSAT.  If you do well I'll take you out for ice cream after!
	Once I explained to Bernie Sanders what an email was after the #DemDebate, he agreed Hillary should be in prison.
	Bernie Sanders may be anti-military but he sure loves shopping at the Salvation Army. #DebateWithBernie #DemDebate http://t.co/e9U6z4W8KB
	Jeb Bush didn't watch the #DemDebate.  He spent the night in the garden watering his plant.  @realDonaldTrump http://t.co/eMiZBeCeVq
	Poor Jim Webb, he was making love to his wife after the #DemDebate when Anderson Cooper burst into bedroom to tell him he was out of time.
	Democrats shouldn't stop at giving illegal immigrants free college and health care. Give them a Tesla and gym membership too.  #DemDebate
	Hillary has new respect for Bernie after his support for non-violent offenders since she's about to become one!  #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Of course Hillary could track down the Chinese hiding in a hotel.  She was married to Bill Clinton.  #DemDebate   @realDonaldTrump
	If these candidates want to get rid of Hillary, throw a bucket of water on her. It worked in the Wizard of Oz.  #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Jim Webb just stop....  
We'll still give you a participation trophy!  
#DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	I keep waiting for Bernie Sanders to start blinking his eyes and yelling "Where am I? Who are all these people?" #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Hillary maybe if your daughter didn't charge $65,000 for a speech, college would be a lot cheaper!  #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Luckily these liberals hate guns because someone might take Jim Webb out back and put him out of his misery.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Hillary has been taking on Climate Change ever since she started having Hot Flashes 40 years ago.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Damn it Hillary, you cackled again!  Two more of my windows just shattered!  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump

	Our greatest National Security Threat is the idea of a Hillary Clinton Presidency.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump

	Hillary could play cornerback in the NFL the way she just backpedaled on Benghazi.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Anderson Cooper is losing control of the #DemDebate.  Come on man, you're a Vanderbilt, start acting like one!  @realDonaldTrump
	Maybe I'm tired, but I'm pretty sure I saw a serpent tail sneak out behind Hillary Clinton's podium.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Sorry Bernie, but I love Quagmire.  He's the best character on Family Guy!  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Is it just me or does Bernie Sanders seem like Larry David doing a Ralph Nader impression?   #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	Why did Bernie Sanders look at Hillary when he said people need to be checked for mental health?  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	No one gets young voters excited like a candidate who smells like Werther's Original and BenGay. #BernieSanders #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	I hope Bernie Sanders has his name and address written on a card in his pocket, because he looks confused. #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Once Hillary figures out how to send an email she'll be unbeatable!   #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump

	Bernie Sanders is so pale tonight that Hillary thought it was the ghost of Vince Foster coming back for revenge #DemDebate @realDonaldTrump
	Obama's opening video message was inspiring.  In fact, it inspired millions of viewers to turn off their TV.  #DemDebate  @realDonaldTrump
	@realDonaldTrump Don't let children watch Hillary at tonight's #DemDebate.  They'll see enough witches this Halloween.
	First question of tonight's #DemDebate "Hillary, are you going to ask for the top or bottom bunk when you go to prison?"  @realDonaldTrump
	Great news!  Monica Lewinsky has agreed to appear in the Hillary Clinton jury selection sketch I just came up with for when I host ##SNL.
	For my opening monologue on Saturday Night Live I'm going to read Obama's plan for Syria.  That will definitely get tons of laughs.
	I'm working on my Jeb Bush impression for when I host Saturday Night Live. That Deer in the headlights look of his is hard to master.
	The #DemDebate will be as exciting as an episode of Murder She Wrote, except the only thing that will get killed is the truth.
	The only way that egomaniac Obama is watching the #DemDebate tonight is if he can see his reflection in the TV screen.  @realDonaldTrump
	Hillary will do great at the #DemDebate as long as the moderator doesn't bring up emails, Benghazi, or infidelity.    @realDonaldTrump
	Hillary and Bernie Sanders should talk before the #DemDebate so they both don't accidentally wear the same pantsuit.   @realDonaldTrump
	Bill Clinton will spend the #DemDebate in the audience checking to see if the women there are honoring #NoBraDay.  @realdonaldtrump
	Las Vegas currently has the over/under for lies Hillary will tell during the #CNNDebate at 48.  I'm betting the over!  @realDonaldTrump
	@realDonaldTrump Bill Clinton just cheered Hillary up by reminding her that Nelson Mendela got elected President after he got out of prison.
	@realDonaldTrump @Politics_Reddit.  Or as Jeb says when he gets caught,  "Oh Dios Mio!!!"
	@realDonaldTrump @ryan_padraic  Even more impressive, Bernie Sanders plans on finishing the debate without taking a nap!
	Hillary tried to taunt me outside my hotel in Las Vegas.  I ordered my employees to taunt her back by holding up a mirror.
	#ComeTogether is trending.  It's also the perfect slogan for the circle jerk that is this week's Democratic #CNNDebate.
	If you want a truly terrifying Halloween costume, just go as Obama's foreign policy.

Are those the names of Columbus' ships or Jeb Bush's last three girlfriends?   
#ColumbusDay
	If President Obama wants to get people excited about Climate Change then he should move to a climate far away from the U.S.   #60minutes
	Obama isn't the most misguided President of all time.  That title belongs to whoever is the President of his fan club.
	In honor of #ColumbusDay if you see something you want that a Native American has don't be afraid to take it!
	Steven Tyler doesn't want me using his song, but he'll keep letting #CarlyFiorina use 'Dude Looks Like A Lady' for her campaign theme?
	Hillary Clinton is such a fan of #TheWalkingDead that pretty soon she's going to live inside a prison like the characters did in Season 3.
	My favorite part of tonight's #TheWalkingDead was when gun-hating Bernie Sanders tried to steal that guy's rifle. http://t.co/xzbOWOdDNj
	I think the hostages ISIS are about to decapitate would agree with Obama on #60Minutes that Climate Change is our biggest concern.
	The reason that horn was going off on #TheWalkingDead was probably because someone saw a "Honk if You Hate Obama" Bumper Sticker.
	I don't know if Greg Hardy will beat women this season, but I'm confident he won't beat other NFL teams.  #Cowboys
	I know it's #NationalComingOutDay but please don't Lindsey Graham.  There are a lot more other ways to get attention for your campaign.
	Republicans need to treat Bobby Jindal better otherwise he might run as a 3rd party candidate.  Now try saying that with a straight face!

	@realDonaldTrump  Liberals fear what they don't understand and unfortunately for liberals they don't understand anything.
	Will it be considered racist if I have the locks changed at the White House once Barack and Michelle move out?
	Who was that man with the horrible wig pretending to be me on #SNL?  Oh it was just @HillaryClinton. http://t.co/qVTx0158H6
	Great to see the Miami Dolphins are representing Florida almost as well as @JebBush is.
	I watched #TheMartian tonight.  It didn't make Mars seem that bad, maybe the Syrian Refugees could go there instead of coming to the U.S.
	Hillary pretending to be me on #SNL was far more convincing than her pretending a YouTube video caused #Benghazi.
	I didn't need a failed drug test to know @Rosie O'Donnell smoked pot. It's clear she's had the munchies for decades  http://t.co/yQ4Dponblu
	No I did not watch @HillaryClinton appear on #SNL tonight.  But I will watch when she appears in front of the parole board in 5 years.
	Bobby Jindal is having a campaign fundraiser today, so if you have any cans or plastic bottles leave them outside so he can collect them.
	Thanks to Jeb's disastrous campaign, invading Iraq is no longer the biggest Bush family debacle.  #stuffhappens
	For someone who is so anti-gun, Hillary Clinton sure shoots her mouth off a lot.
	P. Diddy said such nice things about me and my campaign that I've decided to finally forgive him for killing Tupac.
	I'm not surprised Jeb Bush said #Stuffhappens in response to the Oregon Massacre.  I'm just surprised he didn't say it in Spanish.
	President Trump was featured in a new article.  Check it out http://t.co/58anqJsceW
	I'm really angry at whoever is kicking over the Jeb Bush campaign signs in people's yards.  You should be doing them to Carly Fiorina's too.
	I'm going to turn around America as President the way Patrick Swayze turned around the Double Deuce in "Road House."
	The media needs to stop giving that murderous Oregon scumbag publicity. We shouldn't reward psychos and we should never cut into my air time
	My thoughts and prayers go out to Marco Rubio.  He has a really bad headache but can't get the child safety cap off his bottle of aspirin.
	I programmed my DVR to record #Scandal but instead it recorded Hillary's latest interview.  Honest mistake.
	Putin watching Obama deal with Syria was like watching a 3 year old struggling to tie his shoes. Of course he stepped in and took over!
	As President I'm having construction done on the Statue of Liberty to make her point across the Atlantic to signal immigrants to turn around
	When life gives me @donlemon I make lemonade.
	#CriminalMinds is trending.  What did Hillary do now?
	This kind of behavior is why I'm getting rid of the Secret Service as President.  Besides I don't need them because everyone loves me!
	This biggest difference between Bill Clinton and Obama is Clinton hid a chubby intern under his desk and Obama just hides his Koran.
	I never told anyone this before, but the reason Michael Jackson used to bleach his skin was so he could look more like me.
	Marco Rubio is your typical teenager.  He'll find time to vote for his favorite singer on "The Voice" but not for a Bill in the Senate.
	Marco Rubio could only get 300 people out of 800K to retweet America has potential. That's leadership!   https://t.co/3IxCGAXs4b
	Can someone please get Bobby Jindal another bag of peanuts in Coach?  He's running for President, let's show him some respect!
	LMAO!  Funniest thing I've read all day.  
https://t.co/U2f7hNFMV9
	If only I had a dollar for every lie Hillary Clinton has told... Oh wait, I do.  That's why I'm a billionaire!
	Word on the street is Bernie Sanders is going to join Twitter once he gets a faster AOL dial-up connection.
	Derrick Rose is injured again?  That guy gets hurt more than Jeb Bush's feelings during a GOP Debate.  #DerrickRose
	Instead of donating money to #CarlyFiorina's campaign buy a Powerball ticket instead.  At least that has a chance of winning!
	A homeless guy today asked me for change.  I told him, "Don't worry buddy, America is going to get the change it needs when I'm elected."
	Bill Clinton to appear on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." It'll be the first time in years Hillary will know where he is at that hour.
	Why does Bill Clinton now permanently look like he just saw Hillary stepping out of the shower? http://t.co/aRN7czJ4RC
	Yes I am breaking my Fox News boycott to appear on the O'Reilly Factor but only because I want to show off my new CNN sweatshirt.
	#EdwardSnowden has only been on Twitter a few hours and already sent me a Dick pic. http://t.co/DXqFKHzgON
	I blame myself for Obama.  His entire political career was the result of a stupid bet Carl Icahn and I made after watching Trading Places.
	Edward Snowden releases classified information and he's called a hero. I release Lindsey Graham's phone number and I'm called a prick? WTF?!
	Critics who claim it's hard to round up illegal immigrants clearly have never pulled into a Home Depot in a truck. They practically jump in!
	I'll admit Al Sharpton's tax plan is still better, which is basically just don't pay any and still avoid prison.
	Sean Hannity just released a photo from the night he and Fox News head Roger Ailes discovered Megyn Kelly. http://t.co/H6OjE0dfGF
	How long do I have to wait before I can send my guys to tear up Michelle's vegetable garden to make way for my White House putting green?
	As President anyone making less than 25k won't have to pay income tax, but will have to buy my book 'Art of the Deal' to learn to make money
	If there's a candidate who can get rid of the stench of corruption in Washington, it's the one with his own cologne. http://t.co/WvXpwungRd
	Sorry Hillary, just because they found water on Mars doesn't mean you'll get more illegal aliens registered to vote.  #MarsAnnouncement
	Don't worry Hillary, my tax plan doesn't go after the 15 cents an hour you and the other prisoners will get making license plates.
	I can tell Jeb Bush is hard at work trying to understand my tax plan because he's counting with all 10 fingers.
	I have to warn men nationwide that wearing a Donald Trump mask this Halloween will definitely get you laid! http://t.co/gSN9W6kvNh
	The moon tonight reminded me of Megyn Kelly, there was blood coming out of everywhere!  #SuperBloodMoon http://t.co/MVipMN8Ns1
	Jeb Bush is so stupid he asked why do they call it #60minutes if it is an hour long.
	It was a scary being on #60minutes tonight.  Every time I heard that ticking sound I thought that Muslim boy with the clock was behind me.
	It's too bad Hillary didn't get to watch me on #60minutes tonight because she was too busy howling at the #SuperBloodMoon.
	If I didn't think I was going to win this election then why the hell would I have invested in this sweet coffee mug? http://t.co/jTEHeMhR7U
	I just learned a new pool game, it's called Marco Rubio.  It's just like Marco Polo except it's weak on illegal immigration.
	That crowd didn't boo me today, they were just doing their impression of a ghost.
	Horrible news!  John Boehner accidentally electrocuted himself after crying excessively in his tanning bed.
	Screw it!  If I don't win this election I'm just buying an island and declaring myself king.
	Marco Rubio is a clown!  And unlike Jeb Bush I'm not afraid of clowns.
	John Boehner has resigned so he can take a full-time position as the new spokesperson for Kleenex. http://t.co/PqswceVd2E
	#PopeFrancis and I argued over who God loves more, then he agreed it was me when Melania walked in.  #PopeinNYC http://t.co/w2b0bUU8J2
	#CarlyFiorina said she intends on beating me.  Hopefully it's not with the ugly stick she got beat with.
	In Lane Kiffin's defense he told Nick Saban he'd score a lot when he came to Alabama, he just didn't say it would be with his daughter.
	I don't blame #PopeFrancis for skipping lunch with #Congress to eat with the Homeless.  They're less likely to steal from him.
	First thing I'm going to do as President is have John Boehner's tear ducts removed.  #Congress http://t.co/IPezKoiuJB
	Thanks to my boycott of Fox News the #KellyFile is now losing the ratings battle to reruns of Saved By The Bell.
	#PopeFrancis told everyone to follow the Golden Rule, which means vote for the guy with the most gold.  Thank you for your endorsement Pope!
	#Congress was disappointed to learn the guy in a White Dress coming to speak to them wasn't Bruce Jenner it was just the #Pope.
	For Throwback Thursday lets throw Obama back to wherever he came from.
	Secret Service Agents tackled Pope Francis after he grabbed Obama to check for the 666 birthmark on the back of his head.  #PopeInDC
	I hope my boycott of Fox News doesn't interfere with my cameo on Empire playing a sexy real estate mogul with political aspirations.
	Wow!  President Obama released Bin Laden's bodyguard from GITMO but won't release his birth certificate.
	My boycott of Fox News is going make that network fail faster than Megyn Kelly at a spelling bee.
	Fox News is as Fair and Balanced as that deal we just made with Iran.
	Even the Pope agreed Trump Ice is better than Holy Water.  #PopeInDC http://t.co/cxLyCklm8x
	Treat others how you'd want to be treated, unless it's Rosie O'Donnell then treat her how ever you like.
	Jeb Bush is so dumb that when he heard #YogiBerra died he assumed a Park Ranger shot him while he was trying to steal a picnic basket.
	Ann Coulter is pissing off most of America this morning.  I think she's just practicing for when she goes as Megyn Kelly for Halloween.
	Marco Rubio begged his parents to let him stay up past his bedtime to watch me on #colbertlateshow tonight. http://t.co/IrQ41igJt7
	#NewMuppetPlotlines  Hillary catches Bill in bed with Miss Piggy and once again looks the other way for the sake of her political career.
	I can't wait to watch the #Muppets tonight.  It'll be nice to see Bobby Jindal and Rand Paul in their natural environment.
	Obama is such a bad President that he made liberal Sean Penn go from saving black people to suing them.
	Good for MSNBC for forcing #BrianWilliams to do tonight's broadcast strapped to a polygraph.  Now if only we could do the same to Hillary.
	Obama has asked #PizzaRat to distract the #ChinesePresident long enough to scrounge up $1.3 Trillion to pay him back. http://t.co/RBVoBeQd1u
	Hillary Clinton opposes the #Keystone XL Pipeline, which is ironic since she never had a problem with Bill laying pipe their entire marriage
	Ben Carson please don't enrage Muslims when I have to stand next to you at the debates.  I want to live long enough to be President.
	I asked #BrianWilliams if he was nervous about returning to TV tonight.  He said no, but I think he was lying.
	After dropping out of the election Scott Walker plans on doing what he did when he dropped out of college. Move back home and work at Subway
	The Pope told me every time he's talked with God lately all God wants to discuss is how great my campaign is doing.   #PopeInDC #AskTrump
	Obama has gone into hiding now that the #ChinesePresident has arrived in America looking for the money he owes him. http://t.co/MovD6yWb75
	Ladies could you please #ShoutYourAbortion a little quieter today, the Pope is in town.    #PopeInDC
	Every time I watch Fox News I feel like I'm Joe Pesci in Goodfellas when he gets whacked by his so called friends.
	#PopeInDC Update.  Hillary Clinton vomited pea soup all over him during the first 20 minutes of the Exorcism he was performing on her.
	What do you do if you're a pilot and #AhmedMohamed wants to visit the cockpit?  #AskTrump.  Ummm....   Next question, please.
	Jeb Bush asked me a touching question during #AskTrump.  "Why didn't God make me smart like you?"  Honestly Jeb, I don't know.
	The key to watching the #KellyFile is to watch it on mute.   Megyn Kelly is much more attractive that way.  #AskTrump
	I wish I owned stock in Haterade because people on Twitter were definitely drinking lots of it during #AskTrump.
	New poll reveals Americans overwhelming trust #PizzaRat more than Hillary Clinton. http://t.co/la5tqHIGiO
	Next time @GeraldoRivera freaks out on #TheFive just have a skinhead hit him with a chair.  That always shut him up in the past.   #AskTrump
	It's a shame Abraham Lincoln didn't live long enough to see #PizzaRat and #ShoutYourAbortion trending.  He'd be so proud of America.
	Chris Christie pulled a hamstring trying to get that slice away from #PizzaRat.   #AskTrump http://t.co/tuaxA5YVpk
	Rand Paul is clearly happy in this photo about Scott Walker dropping out of the #2016Election. http://t.co/SbzURi89Hw
	#ScottWalker and Rick Perry have quit, but Bobby Jindal is still running?  That little Indian is more stubborn than Gandhi.   #AskTrump
	I knew #ScottWalker would drop out of this election faster than he dropped out of college!
	That's my last Twitter Q&amp;A. Next time I want to be attacked by trolls, I'll just go to the bridge #CarlyFiorina hangs out under.  #AskTrump
	All the haters who came out for #AskTrump prove people are more afraid of my campaign than what's in that Muslim boy's ticking briefcase.
	Best question I got from my Twitter Q&amp;A was "Is Hillary Clinton evil?"  My response "Define evil."   #AskTrump
	Tom Brady has remained loyal to me ever since I paid Mo Lewis to kill Drew Bledsoe to get him some playing time.  #AskTrump
	Of course I knew Jeb Bush smoked pot.  He'd have to be high to think he could beat me.  #AskTrump
	CNN poll reveals #CarlyFiorina is now in 2nd place.  It's like that old saying, Behind every great man is a woman who looks like a horse.
	R.I.P Jackie Collins.  Your books kept Hillary company many a night when Bill was busy out chasing tail.
	USC collapsed so badly against #Stanford tonight that they looked like John Kerry during negotiations with Iran.
	If I'm supposed to defend President Obama from every whack job who hates him, then I want a Secret Service pension.
	I'm setting the record straight, President Obama is not a Muslim.  He just plays one on TV.
	#CarlyFiorina cheated during the #GOPDebate. The rules said we couldn't wear camouflage to blend into the background. http://t.co/AwOf3KxH4a
	To celebrate my plan on the 2nd Amendment I'll be hosting a gun show tomorrow when I wear a tank top and flex my biceps.
	Hillary doesn't care how good #AhmedMohamed is with a clock, all she cares about is how good he is at destroying emails.
	We don't have to defund Planned Parenthood we just have to let Rick Perry.manage its finances.  It'll go broke faster than his campaign did.
	Sara Lee has just offered me an endorsement deal because I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread!
	I don't know if Obama is a Muslim but I do know when I showed him the cartoon I drew of Muhammad he tried to murder me.
	Chris Christie had suspended his campaign in honor of #NationalCheeseburgerDay.
	#HillarysGreatestAchievement will be not getting her cornbread stolen from a much larger inmate in the prison cafeteria.
	Bristol Palin thinks #AhmedMohamed deserves to go to the White House when he can make a baby in high school not a stupid clock.
	Lindsey Graham put one of the new gay Doritos in his mouth but claims he was drunk and doesn't remember. http://t.co/fx13ArX0CS
	I don't blames Jews for being furious with @AnnCoulter after she gave Iran $150 billion.  Oh wait, that was Obama.  #IstandwithAnn
	I was such a rock star during last night's #GOPDebate that someone threw their panties on stage.  Please don't do that again Lindsey Graham.
	I was so impressive at last night's #GOPDebate that Michael Reagan came up to me afterwards and accidentally called me "Dad."
	The next #GOPDebate will take be held at the George W. Bush Library which is filled entirely with Dr. Seuss books.
	I don't think Jeb Bush has low energy, I just think he has to listen to himself talk so he's always bored.  #GOPDebate
	Carly Fiorina signed thousands of autographs after the #GOPDebate after getting mistaken for Bruce Jenner.
	When Obama heard it was #ConstitutionDay, he immediately asked "What's that?"
	To be completely objective, I totally dominated the #GOPDebate tonight.
	Ronald Reagan loved me so much he wanted to adopt me, but I already put Trump in big letters on all my buildings.  #GOPDebate
	Seriously, Chris Christie your nickname would be True Heart.  More like Blocked Arteries.  #GOPDebate
	I'd put Rosa Parks on the 10 Dollar Bill just because I love the Outkast song so much!  #GOPDebate
	I started to believe in climate change, then I realized my air conditioner was just on the fritz.  #GOPDebate
	These idiots are giving me a headache, hopefully Ben Carson will write me a prescription for a joint.   #GOPDebate
	I'm starting to believe Mike Huckabee is just a blob of tissue.  #GOPDebate
	I totally forgot Ted Cruz was in the #GOPDebate and thought someone just brought a ventriloquist dummy on stage.
	Scott Walker tried to join ISIS but unfortunately they require a college degree.  #GOPDebate
	Jeb, your idiot brother didn't keep my safe, my highly paid team of bodyguards did!    #GOPDebate
	Relax Marco Rubio, if I don't know some Arab leader's name, I'll just give him a cool nickname.  People love that!  #GOPDebate
	Anyone hear that?  I think Marco Rubio's balls finally dropped.  #GOPDebate
	I never knew half the contestants' names on Celebrity Apprentice, but I still got the job done.  #GOPDebate
	Would #CarlyFiorina be offended if I asked her to finish the #GOPDebate with a paper bag over her head?
	Sorry John Kasich, I didn't hear a word you said. Ben Carson and I were busy checking out the hot blonde in the third row. #GOPDebate
	Thousands of people dead nationwide from alcohol poisoning after drinking every time someone says Ronald Reagan during the #GOPDebate.
	Oh God, the Poodle is speaking about taxes now.  #GOPDebate
	If Marco Rubio behaves for the rest of the #GOPDebate I'll let him play in the giant plane behind us afterwards.
	Chris Christie stole his immigration plan from me like he stole that Hershey bar I left unattended.  #GOPDebate
	10 Guys and 1 Girl.  This feels less like a #GOPDebate and more like an episode of The Bachelorette.
	The more Scott Walker speaks, the more obvious it gets which candidate on stage didn't graduate college.  #GOPDebate
	The Statue of Ronald Reagan literally tried to get up and walk out of the room while Mike Huckabee was talking.  #GOPDebate
	I'm trying my hardest not to accidentally say, "Quiet Carly, men are talking."  #GOPDebate
	Rand Paul shouldn't be on this stage, he should be in court suing whoever gave him that hideous poodle haircut.  #GOPDebate
	Jeb Bush's campaign bus just arrived at the Reagan Library for the #GOPDebate. http://t.co/HfdOxNahe4
	I now feel bad I told people Lindsey Graham prefers to pee sitting down.  He told me that in confidence.  #GOPDebate
	I hope I'm not late to the debate.  The Muslim kid I hired to build me a clock never delivered it for some reason.  #IStandWithAhmed
	#CarlyFiorina is busy getting her game face on for the #GOPDebate.  Hopefully it's more attractive than her regular face.
	The only thing Tom Brady is guilty of deflating is my opponents' chances after endorsing me for President! http://t.co/KXN0omcWeG
	The Muslim world needs more boys who can make a clock and also a calendar since they still act like it's  2000 years ago.  #IStandWithAhmed
	I hope Anderson Cooper isn't moderating tonight's #GOPDebate because he'll spend the whole time undressing me with his eyes.
	Buffalo Wild Wings is ruined after @SteveRannazzisi lied about 9/11, which is great news for Trump's House of Wings! http://t.co/SKLHn6Flwd
	I don't blame that school for arresting Bobby Jindal for pretending to be a student.  #IStandWithAhmed http://t.co/8gCH20wHg3
	Obama won't be watching the #GOPDebate, which is unfair since he made us watch him destroy America.
	A new poll reveals I now have enough support from active servicemen to remove Obama from power with a military coup. I'll keep that in mind!
	I love visiting LA!  I can't tell if that bum who begged me for change was Edward Furlong or Nick Stahl, but I know he played John Connor.
	What's up with all the potholes in Los Angeles when it rains?  The streets look like Chris Christie went down them on a pogo stick.
	I just learned in Los Angeles when people do cocaine they now call it a 'Trump Bump' because it gets their heart pumping and ready to party.
	People who think this campaign is a big act, go watch my performance as Waldo's Dad in 1994's Little Rascals. I'm not that good of an actor.
	#CarlyFiorina has opened a kissing booth to raise money for her campaign.  So far the only one who has paid is Hillary.
	Don't worry Jeb Bush, I'll put peepholes in my wall at the border so you can look through them when you want to see your in-laws.
	I guess the 500+ hours I've logged playing Call of Duty:  Black Ops II mean nothing to the critics who say I lack military experience.
	I'll be on the U.S.S. Iowa in California today.  It's kind of small compared to my yacht but it'll have to do. http://t.co/QMbFEMstuc
	I'm in California today and I've already made it rain.  Just another example of the miracles I'm capable of!
	Hillary Clinton is so worried about prison that she was tossing and turning all night in the coffin she sleeps in.
	I love America even more than I love myself.  And we all know how much I love myself!  #trump
	I'm spending the night in Texas at a place called the Alamo. Ted Cruz told me there's no safer place for someone who pissed off Mexicans.
	Jeb Bush is so stupid when I told him America needs to come together, he started organizing a nationwide circle jerk.
	It's unfair Ray Rice can't land a job. That's why I'm trying to get him hired as the elevator attendant at Megyn Kelly's apartment building.
	Bobby Jindal also had a rally tonight.  Luckily, it was small enough for him to hold it in a booth at Red Lobster.  #TrumpInDallas
	My speech in Dallas tonight about immigration was so powerful that it shamed Dirk Nowitzki into going back to Germany.  #TrumpInDallas
	Tonight at my rally a baby uttered its first words which were "Thank You Trump."  You're welcome little guy!  #TrumpInDallas
	I'm not waiting until I'm elected to protect America, that's why me and Mark Cuban are currently lining the border with 10,000 bear traps.
	I only started this campaign to sell hats, but now I'm getting used to the idea of being the next President!  #TrumpInDallas
	My rally in Dallas was amazing!  Even a paralyzed man stood up for the first time in 30 years just to shake my hand.  #TrumpInDallas
	Disney's making a new Mary Poppins. To update it she'll be Mexican and enters the USA by flying over my wall at the border with her umbrella
	#IfTheZombiesAttack Democrats will be safe, since Zombies like to eat brains.
	I won't miss #CelebrityApprentice because this week I'll be around a bunch of barely famous people fighting for the same job.  ##CNNDebate
	Hillary wanted the job on #CelebrityApprentice but she'll be too busy starring on MSNBC'S hit reality series Lockup for the next 3-5 years.
	#ThePerfectGuy was the number one movie at the boxoffice because the title made Americans think it was about me.
	Raiders fans have endured far more suffering in recent years than #SyrianRefugees have.  Why isn't our government helping them?
	I'm in Dallas and invited Ben Carson to attend the #Cowboys game with me.  It's always good to have a doctor on hand when #TonyRomo chokes.
	Floyd Mayweather's record would have been way better than 49-0 if they counted the women he defeated with his fists too. #MayweatherBerto
	I used to think I was God's gift to women, but now I'm starting to believe I'm actually God's gift to America.
	I have a big weekend ahead trying to convince all 8 #RickPerry supporters in America to vote for me instead.
	Marco Rubio unfortunately didn't see how hilarious I was on #jimmyfallon since it comes on past his bed time.
	I was so great on #jimmyfallon last night that NBC offered me my own reality show.
	The only thing funnier than my appearance on  #FallonTonight is the fact Bobby Jindal is still running for President.
	I'm on #jimmyfallon tonight and Hillary Clinton is on Prozac tonight because she's so depressed about going to prison.
	In Rick Perry's defense his campaign was such a disaster it was only fitting to announce its end on 9/11.
	People are shocked to hear Rick Perry dropped out of the election today.  Like me they assumed he dropped out months ago.
	Rosie O'Donnell still thinks 9-11 was an inside job.  Even more insane is she thinks she made a good Betty Rubble in The Flintstones.
	I don't know where Hillary was on 9/11 but it's safe to say she was probably wearing a hideous pantsuit.  #WhereWereYou
	I would totally let #CarlyFiorina enter one of my pageants, but unfortunately I don't own the Westminster Kennel Dog Show.
	14 Years ago today we all witnessed something that we never thought was possible.  George W. Bush reading.   #911Anniversary
	Michael Moore's new documentary is called "Where to Invade Next."  Knowing him, my guess is a refrigerator.
	My boy Tom Brady is dominating the Steelers' secondary almost as hard as I'm dominating my GOP opponents.  #nflkickoff
	After telling the 10000 Syrian Refugees that they'd be relocated to Detroit and Chicago they said no thanks it's safer back home.
	Obama shouldn't be shocked if he gets weird looks on Air Force One tomorrow.  People are always suspicious of Muslims on airplanes on 9-11.
	It's #WorldSuicidePreventionDay so let's take all sharp objects away from Bobby Jindal before we show him his latest poll numbers.
	Who wants to break it to Jeb Bush that those people weren't laughing with him last night, they were laughing at him? http://t.co/Pkx7YrfWRV
	It's like they say in Iran, "He who is without sin, cast the first stone at that woman accused of adultery."  #StopIranDeal
	That damn poodle is pissing on my lawn again, oh wait, it's just Rand Paul. http://t.co/Jzf7VGdz7w
	Later today Marco Rubio will announce he's dropping out of the election to focus on finishing puberty.
	I'm tired of hearing Mike Huckabee talk.  He should remove those staples from his stomach and use them to staple his mouth shut.  #KimDavis
	Bruce Jenner is coming over to Hillary Clinton's house today to finally teach her how to wear makeup.
	If we want to #StopIranDeal we should just wrap it in pork.  Muslims won't go anywhere near it.
	The only way we could have gotten screwed any harder than we did with the #IranDeal is if we let Bill Cosby make us a cocktail.
	In Iran they're calling Obama "The Genie" since the #IranDeal granted them any wish they wanted.
	Stephen Colbert had Jeb Bush on the #LateShow. I guess he couldn't book the 8 candidates beating him in the polls. http://t.co/kAYZ4FeyAj
	If Stephen Colbert told me I was going to be on the #LateShow I would have worn a "I'm With Stupid shirt." http://t.co/0QBAwjzVA8
	Dick Cheney hates the #IranDeal so much that he wants to take it hunting and shoot it in the face.
	Happy Labor Day.  Or as the 93 million people out of work thanks to Obama call it, Monday.
	If you see a suspicious person on Labor Day, it's probably just a Democrat.
	I didn't believe in #BlackLivesMatter until I drafted Marshawn Lynch with the first pick of my Fantasy Football draft.
	When I heard #KimDavis was arrested, I assumed the Fashion Police must have finally caught her. http://t.co/z1YW0hyhju
	I wonder if Hillary Clinton took a photo when she signed her contract with Satan. http://t.co/SYXcDOCwDX
	Rick Perry was going to sign the Republican Loyalty Pledge too, but he couldn't afford the paper it was printed on.
	Yes, I signed the Republicans' loyalty pledge, but I used a pen with disappearing ink.
	Snoop Dogg, who beat a murder conviction, is outraged Tom Brady won in court. Nice to see another liberal with his priorities in order.
	Kim Davis is a hypocrite. One hour after being jailed for refusing to give same sex marriage licenses, she became engaged to her cellmate.
	Disney star Dean Jones died today.  I'm not sure what the cause of death was but my guess is he was murdered by an illegal immigrant.
	Israel knew the #IranDeal was bad for them when Obama finished negotiations by giving Iran's leaders the secret Muslim handshake.
	The #FreddieGray case proves how scary it is to have dark skin in America. That's why I'm cutting back to 2 hours a day in my tanning bed.
	Nothing says how committed Obama is to improving the lives of African-Americans like taking time to go visit Alaska.
	Pope Francis traveled to America this week to hear Hillary's confession. He estimates it will take 6 years to listen to all her sins.
	If you look closely you can still see the price tag on Jeb Bush that the lobbyists forgot to take off after buying him.
	New poll finds 54% of Republicans think Obama is a Muslim.  Which means 46% of Republicans aren't very observant.
	Instead of watching tonight's #KellyFile, watch paint dry. It's far more entertaining and educational than anything Megyn Kelly has to offer
	It's amazing for such a big guy, Chris Christie disappeared from this election very easily.
	Don't worry Hillary, Prison is a lot like Washington D.C. except there's a lot less liars, murderers, and thieves.
	I'm not surprised Hillary Clinton couldn't handle anything confidential.  She learned the art of discretion from her husband.
	The Feds found another 150 emails containing Classified information.  Hillary Clinton's legacy is even more stained than Monica's dress.
	What does it say about Jeb Bush when George W. is the brother with all the talent? http://t.co/OVTJsmSmSZ
	I love being in a Fantasy Football League with Obama.  I traded him Sgt. Bergdahl for Andrew Luck, Calvin Johnson, and Rob Gronkowski.
	If I can shutdown Toronto with just one of my antennas imagine what I'll be able to do to ISIS with our nuclear arsenal.
	The only profound thing ever to happen to Glenn Beck was when he realized that black guy sneaking up behind him was just his shadow.
	After Kanye West announced he'll be running in 2020, George Zimmerman confirmed this morning he will be the one chasing him.
	People stop saying I pulled a Willie Horton on a Bush.  It sounds like a creepy sex act that pervert Anthony Weiner probably pays for.
	My campaign ad slamming Jeb Bush for being weak on illegal immigration wasn't mean, it was an Act of Love!
	Now that I think of it, I haven't actually seen Ben Carson's birth certificate either.
	Ben Carson tied me in latest Iowa poll.  I haven't been tied with anyone since Brad Pitt during the voting for People's Sexiest Man Alive.
	Kirk Cousins named the starting Redskins QB.  #RGIII is just like Obama, he gets worse each year in Washington.
	If Obama gets cold in Alaska while filming #RunningWild with Bear Grylls, he should do what I do, burn copies of "The Audacity of Hope."
	Miley Cyrus was so skanky hosting the #VMAs last night that Anthony Weiner electrocuted himself trying to have sex with his television.
	When I heard an egomaniac from Chicago was running in 2020, I assumed Obama figured out a loophole in the Constitution. #kanyewest
	2020 is going to be an exciting primary for Democrats. #KanyeWest will be running and Hillary Clinton will be getting released from prison.
	Kanye West is waiting until 2020 to get into the White House so Ray J can film himself getting in there first.  #kanyewest
	R.I.P. Wes Craven.  The only thing scarier than your films is the thought of a Hillary Clinton Presidency.
	I don't understand Bobby Jindal.  If he hates me so much, then why did he give me a free Big Gulp today at 7-Eleven?
	The toughest thing about this campaign is pretending to be impressed when Scott Walker brags about running Wisconsin.
	I'm okay with with the University of Texas removing a statue of Jefferson Davis as long as they replace it with a Donald Trump statue.
	Bobby Jindal predicts support for me will fade after "summer silliness" ends.  I might be insulted if I knew who the hell Bobby Jindal was.
	Obama is such a bad President that a sick kid today used his one make-a-wish to request him to resign.
	I love how liberals always bitch about invading Iraq, but refuse to criticize Mexico for invading us.
	Bill Maher called me racist last night on #RealTime.  I really wish Jim Henson never made that stupid muppet.
	Jeb Bush is really pro-gun.  That's why he keeps shooting himself in the foot.
	Charlie Sheen wants to be my Vice President.  Did he think I wouldn't find out his last name is actually Estevez?
	#MarcAnthony said everything that comes out of my mouth isn't worth 2 cents. Why's he so cranky? Was his alimony check from J-Lo late again?
	I have to admit, I even impressed myself tonight during my amazing interview with Sarah Palin.
	Hillary Clinton said I should be ashamed of myself.  Now I'm not going to give her that soap on a rope I bought her for prison.
	Anthony Weiner is such a perv that when he tried to get an endorsement deal with Subway, they said no thanks, we'd rather stick with Jared.
	Sarah Palin will be interviewing me tonight.  She might not be a journalist but she did stay at a Holiday Inn Express.   #SarahPalin
	Is anyone else running for President? I try watching the news to find out but all I see is me!
	I'm all for gay marriage, as long as they honeymoon at one of my luxurious Trump Resorts around the globe.
	Would it be sexist to send Megyn Kelly an Easy-Bake Oven to inspire her to choose another career? http://t.co/vROCvZXXaZ
	I love the Bible so much that I make sure I have a copy in each hotel room I own.  Who else does that?
	Nothing sums up Jeb Bush's campaign quite like hiring a guy with the word CAN'T in his name. @EricCantor
	Great news!  It turns out that 114 million Jeb Bush raised is actually in Pesos.
	Hillary Clinton compared Pro-Life Republicans to Terrorists Groups.  She probably also thinks they attacked our Embassy in #Benghazi.
	I bet the only reason Jorge Ramos is so hard on me is because he's probably Jeb Bush's brother-in-law.
	Lindsey Graham finally figured out his new cell phone. He just sent me this dick pic http://t.co/ubiXKNJcj6
	It's okay that Scott Walker didn't finish college, because I've been schooling him this entire campaign!
	Owen Wilson stars in the new film #NoEscape.  Based on the title I'm guessing it's Bill Clinton's story of his marriage to Hillary.
	Jorge Ramos has come a long way since being an Anderson Cooper impersonator on Hollywood Boulevard. http://t.co/O4sp5VAY68
	Derrick Rose is being accused on rape.  When he said he'd be the next Kobe I thought he meant win a championship.
	Jorge Ramos pissed me off again this morning when he woke me up with his leaf blower doing my lawn.
	If I can give washed-up celebs jobs to do on the Apprentice, I'll definitely be able to find work for average Americans as President!
	I've been attacked more than any candidate in history.  Fortunately, years of excessive tanning has literally left me with thick skin.
	There's no doubt Biden will run. The only question is will he do it before or after Hillary is indicted.
	Next time I'll answer a question from Jorge Ramos is when he asks it from the other side of my wall!
	Sorry Hillary, but the only running you're going to do next fall is during the hour of exercise in the yard prison allows.
	I should have known how stupid Jeb Bush was the moment I saw his campaign bus. http://t.co/38l4uqpDE2
	The more Jeb Bush speaks, the more I think he actually wants me to win.
	I don't want to blame the Dow being down on Obama, but the only thing he knows about Wall Street is Charlie Sheen cries at the end of it.
	Hillary Clinton better be nicer to me if she wants me to give her a Presidential Pardon so she can get out of prison early.
	#FearTheWalkingDead is so unrealistic.  No one stops after hitting someone with their car in East Los Angeles.
	I dealt with brain dead Gary Busey on Celebrity Apprentice, so I could handle a Zombie Apocalypse as President.   #FearTheWalkingDead .
	I doubt Obama will #FearTheWalkingDead.  He'll probably just ignore them like ISIS while they slaughter innocent people.
	As President I'm getting rid of the drinking age, because no American should have to look at Hillary without the use of beer googles.
	Hey Obama, you know who probably needs a vacation?  Those American Prisoners in Iran who you forgot to make part of your deal.
	Hillary Clinton going to prison for her e-mails is like Al Capone going away for Tax Evasion.  It's anti-climatic but I'll take it!
	Political correctness is out of control. Today a doctor delivered an anchor baby and when he slapped it, he was charged with a Hate Crime.
	A couple of these people were so excited to see me, their heads literally exploded.  True story. http://t.co/ttewIVl4VS
	I'm teaming up with Subway for a new charity where we take all #JaredFogle's old fat pants and turn them into tents for the homeless.
	It's obvious long-time Clinton lawyer David Kendall is really good at his job since Hillary and Bill haven't staged his suicide yet.
	Mexico is making it mandatory that all children climb the rope in gym class so they can scale the wall I put up at the border as President.
	If Jeb Bush needed good photoshop, he should have got the guy his brother used to doctor the pictures to invade Iraq. http://t.co/8GdONVLQ8z
	I may not be able to Make America Great Again, but I damn sure will sell a lot of hats trying! http://t.co/xHM7SzTM6x
	My favorite thing about Alabama is how efficient the people there are. They introduce you to their wife and cousin at the same time.
	Al Sharpton had a nightmare last night that racism ended and he had to finally get a real job.
	If you're suffering Insomnia just listen to one of Bernie Sanders speeches before bed.  It works better than Ambien.
	After meeting with her lawyers yesterday, Hillary  spent the morning watching a YouTube video on how to turn a toothbrush into a shiv.
	First thing I'm going to do as President is have a drone shoot down the Stork that keeps bringing Anchor Babies.
	How come when a lesbian actress attacks Ted Cruz he gets sweet adorable #EllenPage and when it happens to me I get Rosie O'Donnell?
	At least Ted Cruz finally found a job he's qualified for.   #ellenpage http://t.co/kg0qLHPkpo
	The rumors aren't true! I won't put TRUMP in big gold letters on the White House when I'm elected. It will be in small letters and tasteful.
	If I could actually influence people in Boston to do things, I wouldn't have them beat up homeless men. I'd have them pronounce their Rs.
	During Obama's vacation in Martha's Vineyard he played the board game Risk.  Not surprisingly, ISIS beat him.
	I'm being blamed for those 2 idiots beating up a guy.  People from Boston do stupid things all the time, just ask Ben Affleck's nanny.
	How can I be racist when my best friend is black? http://t.co/fZTp5Gji1Y
	Running for President is even easier than taking candy from an anchor baby. http://t.co/iPmQlQTDgV
	When officers arrived to arrest Bruce Jenner for manslaughter #CaitlynJenner told them she hasn't seen him in months.
	First thing I'm going to do as President is have John Boehner's tear ducts removed.
	When I explained to Obama that the Constitution was a living document, he ordered Joe Biden to take it to #PlannedParenthood and abort it.
	When you cast your ballot, just ask yourselves, which of these guys has their own brand of bottle water. http://t.co/4O5dafrpyx
	I couldn't sleep last night.  The sound of China and Iran laughing at America kept waking me up!
	@Writeintrump got another shout-out tonight for it's courageous coverage of the Ashley Madison scandal https://t.co/J5ehzKJUbn
	Even if Deez Nuts is fake, his message about making America great again is very real.  #DeezNuts
	As Mike Huckabee explains it, his buddy #JoshDuggar only went on Ashley Madison because he heard it was a good place to meet family members.
	Bill Clinton celebrated his birthday by blowing out his candles and making a wish.  Unfortunately it didn't come true, Hillary's still there
	I'm confused.  Now that #BlackLivesMatter activist Shaun King is actually white, if he dies does it still matter?
	Chris Hanson and the "To Catch A Predator" team were able to apprehend #JaredFogle after having Marco Rubio pretend to be an underage boy.
	Not sure what's more embarrassing, that a guy named Deez Nuts is now running, or that he'll probably be beating Jeb Bush in the polls soon.
	I hope new Presidential candidate Deez Nuts runs a classy campaign.  Last thing anyone needs is for this election to become a circus.
	President Obama has asked Joe Biden to refrain from giggling every time the White House's first transgender staff member enters the room.
	Don't worry Hillary, just because the Feds found incriminating evidence on #JaredFogle's computer doesn't mean they find some on yours.
	I always knew there was something creepy about Jared from Subway ever since I saw him in a 'Rand Paul for President' shirt.  #JaredFogle
	And for the record, I'm only friends with fast food mascots who aren't perverts.  #JaredFogle http://t.co/2iftouGmwp
	Men who go on #AshleyMadison are stupid.  Everyone knows if you're married and want to meet hot women, you buy yourself a beauty pageant!
	The world was a lot safer when Jared from Subway was fat. At least then kids could outrun him.
	Today I'm definitely happy I bought tons of stock in Quiznos.
	Freaky!  I thought I just saw Ronald Reagan, but it turns out I was only looking in a mirror.
	If Victor Frankenstein wants to impress me, let's see him resurrect Scott Walker's campaign.
	Instead of donating money to Ted Cruz's campaign, buy a Powerball ticket instead.  At least that has a chance of winning.
	We need one of those liquor store door chimes at the border, at least then we'd know every time someone entered.
	Hillary Clinton said she actually likes George Zimmerman's paintings.  In her defense, she lies about everything.
	Thank God for the 19th Amendment.  Without it, imagine the confusion Bruce Jenner would have caused at the voting booth.
	Wow, George Zimmerman is actually worse as an artist than he is as a human being. http://t.co/SFqHMSLxp2
	Al Sharpton, at least have the decency to take your hand out of the collection basket while telling black churches to support the #IranDeal.
	Glenn Beck should have voiced the donkey in Shrek, because tonight on Hannity he sounded like a real jackass attacking me.
	Every time Glenn Beck talks all I hear is that "wha wha wha" sound Charlie Brown's teachers used to make.
	When pulling keys out of a fishbowl at a swinger party, don't grab the Clinton's. Trust me, I learned the hard way. http://t.co/a1jdlfO2ux
	Don't tell #JamesHarrison the GOP is giving all the candidates who lose to me participation trophies for running for President.
	Even though I hate Mark Zuckerberg's stance on immigrant workers, I have to admit he's hilarious as Sheldon on the "The Big Bang Theory."
	Mark Zuckerberg just unfriended me on Facebook after I called him out on his love of cheap immigrant labor.
	To prove how conservative I truly am to the GOP, I'm heading to a tattoo parlor today to get a tramp stamp of Ronald Reagan.
	Hillary Clinton claims her and Bill were broke when they left the White House. In reality, they were just morally bankrupt.
	Hollywood is rebooting "Weekend At Bernie's." This time 2 guys pretend a corpse named Bernie Sanders is alive so he can run for President.
	The judge dismissed me from jury duty for landing my helicopter on the courthouse roof. How else did he expect me to get here?!
	Today at jury duty I learned that justice is blind. My guess is it saw Hillary naked.
	For the record I said I could have been Batman. But my parents weren't stupid enough to walk down a dangerous alley at night and get killed.
	I didn't win anything at tonight's #TeenChoiceAwards. Luckily for America, those little morons aren't allowed to vote for President.
	Puto must mean 'Future President' in Spanish, because since I released my immigration policy Mexicans have been calling me it all day long.
	Rosie O'Donnell said I'm part of a war on women.  If I truly hated women, I'd be encouraging Rosie to date more of them.
	Celebrating my immigration policy at El Pollo Loco was a bad idea.  I just bit into a chunk of glass hidden in my burrito.
	The good news for the illegals I'm kicking out is they won't even have time to miss America, they'll be too busy building my wall!
	I'm such a nice guy I even offered Hillary a helicopter ride home from the Iowa Fair. But she's going to fly her broomstick back instead.
	I'm headed to the Iowa State Fair and can't wait to see the clowns, otherwise known as Hillary and Jeb.
	Putin called me last night and revealed he doesn't really want to invade other countries, but he just loves making Obama look like a fool.
	My financial disclosure lists me worth $10 billion. It'll be even more when I take all my change to the Coinstar machine at the supermarket.
	Michael Sam has quit football to focus on his mental health. Now if we can convince Rand Paul to do the same with his presidential campaign.
	Whenever I need a laugh I just remind myself Bobby Jindal is still running for President.
	Running for President is much easier than Mitt Romney and John McCain made it look.
	Marco Rubio is still depressed about Cuba so I'm taking him out for ice cream. That always makes kids happy.
	If Marco Rubio is that upset Obama opened an embassy in Cuba, wait until he finds out he's going to open a #PlannedParenthood there too.
	Things got off to a rocky start in Cuba today, when Castro thought John Kerry was a zombified John F. Kennedy coming back for revenge.
	Hillary Clinton is just happy people are talking about a U.S. Embassy that she didn't allow to get attacked.  #Cuba #Benghazi
	Under Obama's presidency we saw the rise of ISIS and even worse, the rise of the Kardashians.  When I'm president I'll stop both!
	Marco Rubio is so pissed about our embassy opening in #Cuba, that I didn't have the heart to tell him how bad he's doing in the Iowa poll.
	I trust Iran even less than Jennifer Garner will ever trust a nanny.  #IranDeal
	Megyn Kelly just asked me what N.W.A stands for in an attempt to take my words out of context again.  #StraightOuttaCompton
	Wait...  Al Gore is still alive?!
	If this election comes down to who has the hottest daughter, they might as well give me the keys to the White House now.
	Hillary's campaign has asked supporters in lieu of cash donations please send cartons of cigarettes so she can use as currency in prison.
	NBC just officially fired me from Celebrity Apprentice. The joke's on them since the only actual celebrity ever on that show was me!
	Megyn Kelly announced she's taking a vacation. Hopefully it's in Syria.
	Remember Huma, it could always be worse.  You could be married to Anthony Weiner.
	Thanks to @rose_unplugged for having me on her show. Follow her on Twitter.
	I hope Huma Abedin is a big Lee Majors fan, because Hillary is about to make her The Fall Guy.
	The best thing about running for President is that it's really helped me overcome my shyness.
	John Kerry would have been more seriously hurt falling off his bike, but luckily he was wearing the kneepads he bought for dealing with Iran
	My friend's 8 year-old son had to shutdown his lemonade stand because under #Obamacare he couldn't afford his employees' health insurance.
	Fun fact about Hillary Clinton - If you go in the bathroom and shut off the lights then say her name 3 times, she'll appear in the mirror.
	I'm so confident I'll win the Hispanic Vote that I've been practicing saying Gracias 5 times a day in the mirror.
	Those who say I won't appeal to African-American voters clearly forget how excited Will Smith was to meet me http://t.co/xH4OjhLbOs
	Good news everyone.  Rick Perry found twenty bucks in the street, his campaign is back on!
	Anyone know who wrote the theme song for "Charles in Charge?"  I'd love for that guy to write me a catchy campaign jingle.
	Fun Fact - The word Jeb comes from the Hebrew word for "Little Brother who will never be President."
	Parody Trump Twitter account KILLS IT on social media – it’s AWESOME http://t.co/Gz86eXJTMo
	I sent Hillary my Bestseller "The Art Of The Deal" so she could negotiate a better plea bargain with the Feds. http://t.co/pLuZKkOzYA
	Bill Clinton tried to cheer up Hillary this morning by reminding her Nelson Mandela got elected President after he was released from prison.
	The toughest part of doing Sean Hannity yesterday was trying to focus while Megyn Kelly stood off camera and gave me dirty looks.
	Bernie Sanders was seen being forced into a car by #BlackLivesMatter Activists and taken to an early screening of #StraightOuttaCompton.
	Rick Perry's favorite thing about running Texas was trying to read the Dr. Seuss books George Bush left behind in the Governor's Mansion.
	Thankfully it's extremely difficult to make it look like an email server killed itself, otherwise we might never learn Hillary's secrets.
	If Rick Perry didn't want his campaign to go broke, he should have saved money like Rand Paul did by cutting his own hair.
	Don't feel so bad Hillary, the government came in and confiscated Jared from Subway's computer this summer too.
	The FBI has dropped its investigation and returned Hillary Clinton's email server after she warned them of naked photos of her on it.
	Thank you Hollywood Reporter today for a great write up on my Twitter account http://t.co/VzbODONaut
	I haven't flip-flopped on #PlannedParenthood. Besides, legally I have up to 24 weeks before I have to make a decision on abortion.
	Apollo Creed put up a better fight against Ivan Drago than Obama has put up against Putin.
	Geno Smith mumbling with his broken jaw still sounds better than anything Rand Paul has to say.
	If Rick Perry had a nickel for every illegal alien he let sneak into Texas as Governor, he could not only pay his staff but give them raises
	Bill O'Reilly told me his next book will be about President Obama. It's called "Killing America."
	There's too many candidates running, so I'm going to break everyone up into two teams and eliminate a member of the losing team each week.
	Hillary Clinton is so desperate to avoid Benghazi questions, that anytime someone brings it up, she changes the subject to Monica Lewinsky.
	I've put cardboard cutouts of Bill Cosby around the border to scare away illegal female immigrants trying to sneak into America.
	Once again proving how well I can negotiate with the Chinese, I just got three free fortune cookies during lunch at Panda Express.
	Roger Goodell can't believe the Geno Smith incident.  A NFL player actually punched someone who wasn't a woman or child.
	The first thing I'll do as President is bring back Jobs. Seriously, I'm going to clone Steve Jobs so he can create new Apple products.
	I knew Rick Perry was in money trouble when I learned his campaign headquarters was a Dunkin' Donuts in South Carolina that had free Wi-Fi.
	I'd give out Rick Perry's cell phone number but it was shut off days ago because he couldn't pay the bill.
	Rick Perry was going to go on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? to win money to continue his campaign, but he's embarrassed himself enough.
	I'm not sure why everyone is angry in #Ferguson, but I'm guessing they're still furious over the way Fox News treated me.
	Bill Clinton wasn't impressed by Hillary's plan to help with student tuition.  He's been helping put strippers through college for decades.
	#DonaldTrumpsDiary If Megyn Kelly wants me to apologize for my blood remark then she can prove me wrong by swimming in shark-infested water.
	I'm at the sexual-harassment seminar the GOP is making every candidate attend for some reason. Wow, Carly Fiorina has nice legs for her age!
	Hey Hillary, maybe college wouldn't be so expensive if Universities weren't paying your daughter $65,000 for a 10 minute speech.
	And for the record I don't have any beef with Rosie O'Donnell.  She ate it all!
	When I'm President I'm going to destroy ISIS so badly that their new name will be WASWAS.
	#Ferguson really needs to get their act together if they want a legitimate chance of hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics.
	Maybe Fox News hates me because I bring in massive ratings.  That would explain why they love Greg Gutfield so much.
	In my defense, I didn't say anything about Megyn Kelly that she didn't hear when she worked at Hooters.
	#GOPBeLike   If God made Adam and Eve, not Adam And Steve, then who the hell made Steve?
	If I was a character in the #FantasticFour I'd have to be The Human Torch, because I'm burning bridges everywhere I go!   #FoxNews
	Not only did President Obama help kill the American Dream, but he allowed the people at #PlannedParenthood to sell its parts.
	I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for my incredible will.  Actually, my father's incredible will that left me millions of dollars.
	Bill Clinton is pushing for a new law to ban conjugal visits just in case Hillary goes to prison.
	Nothing shows how unified Fox News is than the fact Megyn Kelly, Charles Krauthammer, and Greg Gutfield are all cycling at the same time.
	I may not be able to make America great again, but I sure as hell will make it entertaining again!   #Trump2016
	I really am like Ronald Reagan.  I'm handsome, strong, and will probably have a guy named Bush as Vice President.
	They disinvited me from a #RedState event for my Megyn Kelly bleeding comments.  That's okay, I saw enough Red Thursday to last a lifetime.
	I was just offered an endorsement deal with Pam cooking spray, since no controversy sticks to me.
	If Fox News hates me now, just wait until they get the bill for my appearance fee last night.
	The only reason I assumed Megyn Kelly was on her period was the large number of bears gathered outside the arena last night.
	Even Bill Maher admits Fox tried to put a stake in me.  And if anyone knows about stakes it's that pasty little vampire.
	I'm not a neurosurgeon but Ben Carson is and even he thought Megyn Kelly was acting like she had a brain injury during the #GOPDebate.
	Was last night's #GOPDebate sponsored by Haterade?  It sure felt like it.
	Why is Fox News criticizing me so much today?  The only thing they should be criticizing is Rand Paul's stupid poodle haircut.  #GOPDebate
	Charles Krauthammer really pissed me off today. Wait until tomorrow when he shows up at Fox News and discovers I had all the ramps removed.
	Liberals who claim Mexicans aren't violent obviously have never watched George Lopez butcher comedy on stage before.
	Megyn Kelly was just pissed at me during the #GOBDebate because I stopped being into blondes in the 90s.
	What was with Fox News peer pressuring me to take their stupid pledge? I'm surprised they didn't try tricking me into playing Truth or Dare.
	Does Apple have an iPhone app for your Shit List?  If they do, Megyn Kelly is the first name I'm putting on mine.
	The FCC should hit Fox News with a fine for False Advertising for claiming it's "Fair and Balanced" after their hatchet job on me last night
	Megyn Kelly can't handle that I'm putting the PARTY back in the Republican Party.
	When Megyn Kelly said she might bring up Rosie O'Donnell in the #GOPDebate, I assumed the question would be is Euthanasia ever justified.
	When Megyn Kelly was attacking me like a psycho during the #GOPDebate, Jeb Bush whispered to me, "This is why I don't date white chicks."
	I don't know what MSNBC pays, but it must be pretty good since Megyn Kelly is trying her hardest to land a job there.  #GOPDebate
	Fox has a lot of nerve. They attack me last night and now they call a film "Fantastic" that got 9% on Rotten Tomatoes.  #FantasticFour
	The reason my Casino went bankrupt in Atlantic City was because I had an all-you-can-eat buffet in the same state as Chris Christie.
	If last night's #GOPDebate was an episode of Scooby Doo I would have ripped off Megyn Kelly's mask and discovered it was Anderson Cooper.
	Obama better not leave his prayer rug behind in the Oval Office when I get elected because I'll throw it out.   #GOPDebate
	I had a nightmare last night I woke Rosie O'Donnell from hibernation when I said her name at the #GOPDebate and she came after me.
	I'm going to ask Fox News to remove Megyn Kelly from the next debate.  Our sexual tension is making everyone uncomfortable.
	#GOPDebate After Party Update: Chris Christie's drunk and wants to yell at Rand Paul about 9-11, but Scott Walker took the Poodle for a walk
	#GOPDebate After Party Update:  Rubio, Cruz, and Bush are huddled in the corner speaking Spanish. I think they're plotting against me.
	#GOPDebate After Party Update: I'm still waiting for Ben Carson to introduce me to those twins he bragged about.  I hope they're blondes.
	Hey Megan Kelly, ask Kelly Osbourne how attacking me this week worked out for her.  #GOPDebate
	Anyone know why Megan Kelly was so pissed at me during the #GOPDebate? I'm pretty sure I was never married to her.
	I'm at the #GOPDebate After Party. Rand Paul couldn't get in since the bar we're at doesn't allow Poodles.
	I have to be objective, I totally dominated that debate.  #GOPDebate
	Chris Christie's Dad worked at the Breyer's Ice Cream Factory? So many questions now answered.   #GOPDebate
	I talk to God all the time.  Little known fact, he tells me who to pick each season of "Celebrity Apprentice." It's his favorite show!
	If you think Obama made a horrible trade for Bergdahl, you should see some of the ones he makes in our fantasy football league.
	I'm all for the 2nd Amendment, but sorry Rand Paul, anyone who makes the decision to get that hair cut shouldn't own a gun.  #GOPDebate
	I'm the only one on stage who can handle Iran. If anyone can understand Persians, it's a guy who lives in a Gold Penthouse. #GOPDebate
	Jeb Bush refers to himself as Vito Corleone. I always thought he was Fredo.  #GOPDebate
	I not only made Hillary Clinton go to my wedding, but I also made her be my Best Man.  #GOPDebate
	I knew the war in Iraq was a bad idea, just like I knew letting that blind guy cut Rand Paul's hair was a bad idea.  #GOPDebate
	Ted Cruz really looks like a ventriloquist dummy. I'm not going to lie, it's freaking me out.  #GOPDebate
	Chris Christie only gave Obama that big hug because the President had Bacon Bits in his pocket.   #GOPDebate
	Every time that bell rings Rand Paul's little poodle ears keep perking up.  #GOPDebate
	Hey Jeb Bush, explain to Kate Steinle how illegal immigration is an act of love.  #GOPDebate
	Rand Paul's haircut is really distracting. I almost yelled "Rand get your leash it's time for your walk."  #GOPDebate
	Megan Kelly is angrier tonight than Rosie O'Donnell on a diet.  #GOPDebate
	Marco Rubio admitted he's poor. Like we couldn't tell that already from his suit.  #GOPDebate
	Cheap tactic by Rand Paul getting the same haircut as my poodle to distract me.  #GOPDebate
	To prove I'm a good sport, I'm giving all the losers of tonight's #GOPDebate The Apprentice board game to take home. http://t.co/4hCRRRLV4a
	Thank God the #GOPDebate isn't on CNN. I couldn't handle Anderson Cooper undressing me with his eyes all night as he moderates.
	I'm just going to come out and say it. Jeb Bush is the Emilio Estevez of the Bush family.  #GOPDebate
	All proceeds from tonight's #GOPDebate will go to a very needy charity. Carly Fiorina's campaign fund.
	#ElChapo is here at the #GOPDebate waiting for me!  Oh wait, false alarm, it's just Jeb Bush's brother-in-law.
	Who won the first debate today?  Better question, who cares?
	Is it rude to drop the mic after delivering an awesome line during the #GOPDebate? I don't care if it is, I'm doing it anyway!
	I'm going to have to take the long way to the #GOPDebate because the bridge is closed. Well played Chris Christie. Well played.
	With less than 3 hours until the #GOPDebate my opponents are hard at work practicing their shocked face for the things I'm going to say.
	Fox is bringing Prison Break back just in time for Hillary to pick up some useful pointers.
	Screw the #GOPDebate! Instead, tonight let's play one game of Trump, winner takes all. http://t.co/Qx4XyvN3gT
	Luckily Ben Carson can write prescriptions because he and the other candidates will be so depressed after I destroy them they'll need Prozac
	Since the debate is on Fox News, does that mean William Devane is going to interrupt me every 10 minutes to tell us to buy gold?
	It was very sweet of Jeb Bush's in-laws to sneak over the border this week so they could support him at tonight's debate.
	I'm going to pull a Carol Burnett and tug on my ear so Rick Perry will know I'm thinking about him when he's watching the debate at home.
	I really hope John Kasich wears a name tag at tonight's debate, because like most of America I have no idea what he looks like.
	I'm really going to psych out my opponents by playing MC Hammer's "Can't Touch This" as I step out on the debate stage tonight.
	I wonder which candidate will make the first lame "You're Fired" joke during tonight's debate. My money is on Huckabee.
	I'm bringing a Donald Trump Serta mattress to the debate just in case I fall asleep when Jeb Bush is talking.
	Chris Christie just called me and asked if we could change tomorrow night's debate to a pie eating contest instead.
	My campaign philosophy is simple. Do and say the exact opposite of what Mitt Romney did.   #Trump2016
	Bill Clinton did call me. He wanted me to go on "Celebrity Wife Swap."  He didn't realize you get your wife back at the end of the episode.
	We need to bring back school prayer, because let's be honest after Obama America can use every prayer it can get.
	Yesterday President Obama turned 54 or so he says. I'd have to see his birth certificate to know for sure.
	The only thing I'm more shocked at than Kelly Osbourne's bigoted comment is the fact someone was actually watching "The View" to catch it.
	Chris Christie would be an awful President. Instead of filling his cabinet with qualified people he'd probably just fill it with junk food
	I'd hate to be the Latino who has to clean Kelly Osbourne's toilet, because if she's anything like her apology she's full of shit!
	And for the record Kelly Osbourne, the woman who cleans my toilet is a sweet little Vietnamese lady.
	I don't know which is sadder, the fact Kermit and Miss Piggy broke up, or that Bill Clinton already hit on her.
	If people are mad at Kelly Osbourne now, just wait until they find out she's dating the Dentist who killed #CecilTheLion.
	Maybe Kelly Osbourne was just angry at Latinos because one of them did that to her hair. http://t.co/rOTlV1vT5u
	Kelly Osbourne thinks Mexicans only clean toilets. It turns out the Fashion Police is more racist than the real Police.
	It's too bad Kelly Osbourne doesn't mumble incoherently like her Dad, then no one could tell when she's being racist.
	Hillary Clinton better be nicer to me if she wants me to give her Presidential Pardon so she can get out of prison earlier.
	If Liberals protected our border as hard as they protect #PlannedParenthood this country would be a lot safer!
	I'm halfway through binge watching all 120 episodes of the sitcom "George Lopez" just to prove I'm not racist.
	I'm against #PlannedParenthood because if everyone got abortions we'd never get to see people dancing over paternity tests on Maury Povich.
	The only way I can lose this election now is if all of my supporters are murdered by illegal aliens.
	Now that John Stewart is going off the air, I guess I'll have to turn on MSNBC to laugh at fake news.
	Why does Bill Clinton love licking whipped cream off a stripper? Because he can cheat on Hillary and his diet at the same time.
	Senate shoots down bill to defund #PlannedParenthood after fearing its closure would only lead to more seasons of MTV's "Teen Mom."
	Bobby Jindal said if he's not invited to the debate he's changing his name back to M. Night Shyamalan and directing movies again.
	Lindsey Graham thinks the only reason he hasn't been invited to the debate yet is because no one knows his new phone number.
	The only reason I didn't become President earlier was because if I solved all of America's problems I'd have nothing to bitch about.
	I'm so rich that one time instead of passing a kidney stone, a gold nugget came out. True story.
	My favorite part of the New Yorker article on Darren Wilson was when he said, "I'm just grateful I'm not that dentist who killed the lion."
	This season #TrueDetective is so convoluted and poorly planned out that I'm pretty sure the guy who wrote it also wrote Obamacare.
	I don't blame African-Americans for hating The Police. They robbed us of great music when Sting quit the band.
	The Catholic Church performed an Exorcism this weekend. It turned out the woman wasn't possessed, she was just a Democrat.
	If Eagles coach Chip Kelly hated Black players as much as people say he does, wouldn't he just coach hockey?
	If you're not going to vote for me, then don't vote. I'm sure you can find something better to do on Election Day.  #Trump2016
	If Tom Cruise really wants to take on an Impossible Mission, he should help Jeb Bush try to beat me for the GOP Nomination.
	The only thing Rick Perry has to worry about debating Thursday is where he'll be watching me and the real candidates on television.
	There's no doubt Biden will run. The only question is will he do it before or after Hillary is indicted.  #Trump2016
	I'm shocked about Baltimore's homicide epidemic.  It looked like such a great place to live on "The Wire."
	Baltimore has the highest homicide rate in 43 years, but Liberals aren't worried because the city's Lion fatalities are at an all-time low.
	Yes I did give Hillary Clinton money in the past, but that was only so she could buy a less hideous pant suit.
	Don't listen to the audio version of Marco Rubio's book while driving. You'll fall asleep and could kill someone. http://t.co/bBIWmyWq6P
	Unlike politicians, lobbyists can't buy me. But what they can buy is my absolutely refreshing Trump Ice. http://t.co/EgEeXoWH5W
	Selma Hayek is now attacking me.  I won't even respond to someone who got out acted by the snake she was wearing in From Dusk Till Dawn.
	They've finally found wreckage of missing Flight #MH370.  Now if they could find Obama's birth certificate I'd really be impressed.
	Burger King got rid of their slogan "Have it Your Way" after I asked the guy making my Whopper to wash his hands first.
	I've given lots of money to Charity over the years. And yes, Charity is the name of my favorite stripper.
	President Obama finally read the Constitution last night and was overheard saying, "So that's why everyone is mad at me."
	I'm glad James Woods is suing a Twitter Troll for calling him a coke-addict. If Woods wins, it saves me time vetting him for Vice President.
	That Twitter Troll James Woods is suing is screwed. The reason Woods is always excited isn't cocaine, it's because he's a Republican!
	In classic Apprentice tradition, I'm sending all the losers in next week's debate home in a cab.   #Trump2016
	I won't mind if the viewers watching the debate go to the bathroom when my opponents are talking. In fact, I recommend it.   #Trump2016
	Only white people are racist. That's why African-Americans and Asian liquor store owners get along so well.
	Michelle Obama is still holding a grudge against me for accidentally calling her Omarosa when I met her for the first time.
	I'm so rich, even my shadow has a trust fund!    #Trump2016
	I was reading my son a bedtime story about a puppet who constantly lies. No, it wasn't Pinocchio, it was Hillary Clinton's autobiography.
	I don't know if this is an ominous sign for Obama's #IranDeal, but Iran just released a new world atlas where Israel glows in the dark.
	Tom Cruise tried to get me to join Scientology but I told him the only aliens I believe in are the violent ones sneaking across our border.
	I'm already talking to China to find out who built their Great Wall so I can have them build mine at our border.
	No, I did not like breast milk as a baby. But I loved the silver spoon I was born with.  #Trump2016
	When talking to kids about #CecilTheLion, leave out the occupation of who murdered him. Kids are scared enough of going to the dentist.
	I'm old fashion on abortion. It should only be allowed in cases of rape, incest, and rich married guys who got their girlfriends pregnant.
	Now that Chris Christie knows I hate breast milk, I hope he doesn't start milking his during the debate to distract me.
	Rick Perry is only wearing those glasses to bait me into calling him Four Eyes so I'll lose the nerd vote. http://t.co/SsMbU0Zf2H
	Morgan Freeman is in an ad saying how good Obama's Iran Deal is. He also thought Ted 2 was a good idea and look how awful that turned out.
	If my calculations are correct, shouldn't #CeciltheLion still have 8 lives left?
	In regards to this breast milk scandal the liberal media is trying to hurt me with. I'm not anti-women, I'm just lactose intolerant!
	Rick Perry claims as President he'll get America through these hard times.  He can't even get himself through the first Harry Potter book.
	Hillary Clinton is now being investigated by the IRS for not paying taxes when she sold her soul.   #Trump2016
	I couldn't sleep last night, the sound of China and Mexico laughing at our country kept waking me up.    #Trump2016
	If Jimmy Kimmel got that emotional about #CecilTheLion then he shouldn't watch Detroit play football. The Lions are always getting killed.
	Are the kids of America too fat or going to bed hungry every night? Make up your mind liberal media, you're confusing me!
	I'd like to thank MSNBC and Chris Hayes for airing my statement about #CecilTheLion's murder tonight. http://t.co/tEaZBHeRAz
	I never knew Cecil personally, but I do have the heart of a lion, so I'm dedicating my Presidency to his memory.  #CecilTheLion
	If America is going to compete with China, then we should replace Take Your Kid To Work Day with Get Your Kid A Job Day.
	In my son's defense he thought he had hunted down Rosie O'Donnell. Anyone can see it's an honest mistake. http://t.co/J5bwJ6w7hL
	Michael Bay releases first image of actor playing Hillary Clinton in his exciting new Benghazi drama 13 Hours. http://t.co/f3omGb9P53
	I sent Hillary Clinton an email with a link to the trailer for Michael Bay's Benghazi film 13 Hours. Too bad she already deleted it.
	This whole #CecilTheLion thing could have been worse.  Can you imagine the riots if a white dentist murdered a black panther instead?
	I don't want to politicize #CecilTheLion's murder, but he was doing fine in Africa until Obama went over there.   #Trump2016
	If #CecilTheLion was allowed to carry a concealed weapon, he would be alive today.  #NRA
	Fun fact: The Dentist who murdered #CecilTheLion is a huge Jeb Bush Supporter.    #Trump2016
	That scumbag dentist is now claiming #CecilTheLion's brother Scar was responsible for his death. http://t.co/SjYbwjGuEC
	I may be 69 years old, but don't worry voters, all my vital organs are from a young Indian boy, whose parents I rewarded generously.
	Why hasn't Roger Goodell suspended Lindsey Graham for destroying his phone?    #TomBrady
	Tom Brady got 4 games for destroying a phone. Greg Hardy got 4 games for destroying a woman's face.  Good work Roger Goodell!
	The Tom Brady suspension is an outrage! I thought you had to go to Walter Reed to see a Patriot treated this horribly.
	Roger Goodell must be a supermodel because he just screwed Tom Brady.
	Every time the phone rings in the Oval Office President Obama yells, "Don't answer it! It's probably the bill collectors from China again."
	The Daily Beast is now trying to take me down.  I always knew any publication that named itself after Rosie O'Donnell was bad news,
	Mexico will win Gold in pole vaulting at the 2024 Olympics since they'll get plenty of practice trying to get over my wall at the border.
	Hillary is now blaming the emails that got erased on a computer virus Bill Clinton accidentally got while looking at midget porn online.
	I'm officially tired of homeless people with witty cardboard signs.  If you're that clever get a job!
	I can relate to Bruce Jenner on #IAmCait. I remember telling my mom even though I was born a millionaire in my heart I was a billionaire.
	I credit Bruce Jenner for doing whatever it takes to avoid prostate cancer.  #IAmCait
	I just watched the box-office bomb #Pixels. At this rate, even ISIS wouldn't put Adam Sandler in one of their films.
	Come on, Mike Huckabee! You're running for President, you can't just go shooting your mouth off without thinking.  #Trump2016
	If we learned anything this week it's that wrestling is fake but Hulk Hogan's disdain for African-Americans is very real.
	When I was a boy I wanted to grow up to be the Bond villain Goldfinger. Now I'm willing to settle on just being President.  #Trump2016
	Mike Huckabee comparing Obama to Hitler doesn't even make sense.  Hitler wasn't Muslim.   #Trump2016
	What's the difference between giving money to a hooker and a politician? You pay a hooker to screw you and a politician to screw others!
	Mike Huckabee thinks saying offensive things about Obama will help his Presidential campaign.  I wonder where he got that idea?  #Trump2016
	In Iran it is illegal to smoke marijuana but legal to get stoned.
	If you build a man a fire, you keep him warm for a night.  If you set a man on fire, you keep him warm for the rest of his life.
	President Obama screwed up cooking a Hot Pocket yesterday and blamed it on the Bush Administration.
	New poll says I'm actually more popular with Vets than John McCain is.  I'm also more popular with doctors who treat humans.  #Trump2016
	George Lopez is in talks to replace me on "Celebrity Apprentice." Under Obama even billionaires are now losing their jobs to Mexicans.
	Anderson Cooper should leave me alone and focus on finally interviewing the Ghost who scared him as a child and turned his hair white.
	Will it be considered racist if I have the locks changed at the White House once Barack and Michelle move out?  #Trump2016
	Mexico is making it mandatory that all children climb the rope in gym class so they can scale the wall I put up at the border as President.
	It was a touching sight today in Kenya when President Obama visited the hospital he was born in.     #Trump2016
	Don't be jealous of other people, unless it's me, then it's okay to be jealous.
	First thing I'll do when I become President is head down to Area 51 and use that secret alien technology to stimulate the economy.
	I love America even more than I love myself. And we all know how much I love myself!   #Trump2016
	How I'd stop ISIS -- Set up fake Muhammad cartoon contests all over the world and when the terrorists show up to wreak havoc, we kill them!
	Why am I running for the Republican nomination? Same reason I make my wife shave down there. I HATE BUSH!
	Donald Sterling called Hulk Hogan to cheer him up by saying, " At least they didn't take the Los Angeles Clippers away from you."
	Hillary Clinton once said to me, "I scratch your back, you scratch mine." And I responded, "Yeah, but yours is a lot more hairy. No deal!"
	Why don't Liberals demand we ban alcohol every time there's a DUI death? Speaking of alcohol, buy Trump Vodka, it's the best!  #2ndAmendment
	I'm actually surprised #DennisRodman didn't endorse Chris Christie since he's the candidate that most resembles a basketball.
	I have a lot in common with Dennis Rodman's pal Kim Jong-un. We both inherited wealth and power and get teased endlessly for our great hair.
	Dennis Rodman endorsed me for President because he knows I'll defend the border like he used to defend the rim.   #Trump2016
	Hulk Hogan being racist doesn't change the fact that "No Holds Barred" is one of the finest American films ever made. http://t.co/DdSiF1sLm5
	President Obama thought he had a polyp but it turned out to be Jon Stewart.  #Trump2016 http://t.co/bDZnKBqFAu
	Hulk Hogan is no longer in the WWE Hall of Fame, but Donald Trump still is! http://t.co/HequXiJJ9O
	Now that I know Hulk hogan is a racist, I'm starting to wonder what NWO was really short for.  #WWE #HulkHogan http://t.co/SY16hSU4zg
	Hulk Hogan, if you thought wrestling was fake, wait until you see Al Sharpton's outrage over this.  #HulkHogan
	This shows how much progress we've made on Civil Rights when we're shocked a white trash wrestler uses the N-Word in private. #HulkHogan
	I hope this Hulk Hogan racism controversy doesn't taint all the fake matches he won during his career.  #WWE #HulkHogan
	I still don't know what's worse. Hulk Hogan releasing N-bombs or Hulk Hogan releasing his daughter's awful music on the world.
	The best way to describe my campaign is imagine Mitt Romney and Andrew Dice Clay had a baby and that baby ran for President.
	When I'm elected, I'll give out the phone numbers of every politician. They work for us. Employers should have employees' phone numbers.
	If we want Obama to visit the border, we should just throw a fundraiser there.
	In Nicolas Cage's next film he will try to rescue Sarah Palin because that woman is a National Treasure.
	I'm so sick and tired of socialist kindergarten teachers telling our kids to share.
	I almost got raped at the border today in #Laredo but luckily I wore my chastity belt.  It's much tougher to get into than America!
	For throwback Thursday lets throw Obama back to wherever he came from.  #Trump2016
	I wore this sweet hat today because I wanted America to focus on the issue of illegal immigration and not my hair. http://t.co/GVxFDYuxDZ
	I played Pink Floyd's The Wall at the border in Laredo to let those illegal aliens know what's coming when I'm elected.  #Trump2016
	Update from my trip to Texas.  I've seen overweight high school girls more secure than our border.  #Trump2016
	Chris Christie rushed to the hospital after trying to eat the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on #NationalHotDogDay.
	Once you realize the Sharks in #Sharknado3 are metaphors for murderous illegal immigrants, the movie becomes quite brilliant.
	I always assumed the alien invasion of America would involve more spaceships.     #Trump2016
	If Bruce Jenner can become a woman, then maybe there's hope for Hillary Clinton.
	How would I have handled Iraq? Ask any woman I've been with. Once I'm in I always finish the job!
	Hillary Clinton couldn't even keep women out of her husband's bed so how does she think she'll keep illegal aliens out as President?
	Lindsay Graham is so white that me and my Black friends call him "Graham Cracker."   #Trump2016
	#NickiMinaj don't play the Race Card with Taylor Swift and the #VMAs. Play the Trump Card because the Trump Card always wins.
	President Obama is heading to Kenya. He probably needed to pick up a copy of his birth certificate.
	The reason I missed Vietnam was because of the medical deferment I got after injuring myself diving into my father's money pit.  #Trump2016
	I'm heading to the border today and giving masks for my supporters to wear so Mexicans won't know who to attack. http://t.co/3Azq3w39G7
	Obama now claims the 2nd Amendment's Right to Bear Arms means Homosexuals can wear tank tops where ever they want.
	When you cast your ballot, just ask yourselves, which of these guys has their own brand of bottle water.  #Trump2016
	People think I'm racial profiling, when in reality I'm simply checking out black chicks.   #Trump2016
	If we don't deal with this illegal immigration epidemic, pretty soon we'll have to rename every state New Mexico.
	If Spider-Man's spider senses go off every time he's near a group of Black teenagers, does that make him racist?
	I've taken on Rosie O'Donnell and won, so the idea of going up against ISIS as President doesn't scare me one bit!
	I figured out why ISIS is so angry.  Their movies keep getting turned down by Sundance.
	Obama's response to watching Ant-Man. "He controls hundreds of ants, big deal. I control millions of leeches by promising them free stuff."
	Hillary Clinton is not a smart woman. She couldn't even figure out why Bill's cigars smelled so funny.
	Where was Planned Parenthood when Victor Frankenstein was alive?  It sure would have saved him a lot of trouble looking for parts.
	I inherited millions of dollars from my dad, so what? Would you rather me inherit socialist ideology from my dad like Obama did?
	When I'm President, I'm getting rid of Air Force One because my jet is better!
	If there really was such a thing as a hooker with a heart of gold, wouldn't her pimp just kill her so he could rip it out and sell?
	This biggest difference between Bill Clinton and Obama is Clinton hid a chubby intern under his desk and Obama just hides his Koran.
	ET was liberal Hollywood's way of indoctrinating the youth of America into feeling bad for illegal aliens.
	If America was an episode of Scooby Doo, we'd rip the mask off President Obama and discover it's been Osama bin Laden this whole time.
	Thanks to Obama not protecting our borders, America is now even easier to get into than University of Phoenix.  #Trump2016
	Al Sharpton had a nightmare last night that racism vanished and he had to get a real job.
	I just sold Rick Perry and Marco Rubio's Social Security numbers to the Russian Mob. Lunch is on me today.  #LindseyGraham
	I'm feeling generous today. Who wants the alarm code to Jeb Bush's house?    #LindseyGraham
	I won't give out Hillary Clinton's full cellphone number, just the first three digits. 666
	If Lindsey Graham didn't want me to give out his cellphone number then he shouldn't have written it on the men's room wall.
	NBC wants to replace me on "Celebrity Apprentice" with George Lopez. The 5 people who watched his talk show "Lopez Tonight" will be thrilled
	Anyone have Bree Newsome's phone number? Maybe she'll climb up the White House flagpole and lower the flag for our murdered Marines.
	Obama refuses to lower the flag at the White House for the murdered Marines, because he's too busy lowering the bar he set as President.
	I'm so rich I have an ATM machine in my bathroom just in case I run out of toilet paper.  #Trump2016
	You don't have to be Sigourney Weaver to realize how lethal aliens can be.  #secureourborders
	Screw it! If I don't win this election I'm just buying myself an island and declaring myself king.   #Trump2016
	John McCain was lucky I wasn't in charge of the Viet Cong because as this campaign has shown, I take no prisoners!   #Trump2016
	I've never touched alcohol in my life because I'm terrified of saying something obnoxious.  #Trump2016
	The marriage broke up because #MirandaLambert wanted to raise their future children Liberal and #BlakeShelton wanted to raise them smart.
	Anytime a country music marriage ends without a domestic violence arrest or a dog getting shot is good news.  #BlakeShelton #MirandaLambert
	We need stricter gun control laws before millions of wives find out their husbands are members of #AshleyMadison.
	If John McCain hated his POW camp so much, then why did he and Obama try their best to make Walter Reed resemble it? #Trump2016
	Hey Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio, how does my ass look? You guys have a great view of it since you're behind me in the polls.
	Sorry mainstream media, I can't hear your attacks on me because I'm listening to Taylor Swift's "Shake it Off" on my iPod.  #Trump2016
	From now on every time I eat a hero sandwich, I'll call it a John McCain.   #Trump2016
	That idiot Matt Lauer should ask Obama how he feels about captured vets since he's doing nothing to get that poor Marine out of Iran.
	@realDonaldTrump Maybe if let illegal immigrants get treated at Walter Reed, Obama would fix up the place.
	John McCain is so old, I just assumed he was a POW in the Civil War.
	I think divorce attorneys were behind the hacking of #AshleyMadison.
	Screw Matt Lauer! How can yesterday's news be allowed to host a show called TODAY?
	The media is acting like I'm the one who held John McCain prisoner!
	Screw the primary, I challenge all Republican candidates to a game of Trump, winner takes all! http://t.co/fddYAdcwGY
	@CNNPolitics @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump  If McCain was so great, why didn't Rambo rescue him in First Blood: Part 2?
	@CBSEveningNews @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump  Believe me, I know a hero when I see one. And I see one every time I look in a mirror.
	@TIME How about this? From now until Labor Day all veterans get 10% off at any of my luxurious Trump resorts. The coupon code is: McCain.
	Not many people know this but the novel The Great Gatsby was actually based on me.
	People haven't seen a political campaign as inspired as mine since Richard Pryor ran for mayor in Brewster's Millions.
	Say what you mean, and mean what you say. And sometimes, say mean things!
	I'm not sure how the man found in Demi Moore's swimming pool died, but it's probably safe to say he was drowned by an illegal immigrant.
	When I heard there was something at Demi Moore's house paramedics couldn't revive I assumed it was her career.
	Despite what the mainstream media is saying, I love vets! That's why I always tip them an extra $100 when I bring my dog in for a checkup.
	I love John McCain. In fact, when he stayed at my Mar-A-Lago estate I had a bamboo cage constructed for him to sleep in so he'd feel at home
	I don't recall making those comments about John McCain. Last thing I remember is Bill Cosby making me a drink.
	I'm changing my campaign song to Nirvana's "All Apologies."
	I just finished watching Deer Hunter for the first time. That's what John McCain went through? No wonder why everyone's so pissed at me.
	Okay, I'll admit it, John McCain is a national hero. It takes one to know one.
	Just watched Jurassic World. It's a shame we couldn't use Raptors around our borders. Immigration problem solved!
	Actually Jimmy Stewart, every time a bell rings 500 more violent illegal aliens sneak into this country.
	To prove how dedicated I am to America, I'm heading to a tattoo parlor today to get a tramp stamp of a bald eagle.
	Mitt Romney is now attacking me. He should go back to Staples and staple his mouth shut!
	John McCain spent 5 years in a POW camp. I spent 12 years on NBC so I can relate to his suffering.
	I've escaped bankruptcy 4 times so I'm pretty sure I could have escaped John McCain's POW camp in Vietnam.
	In defense of my comments on John McCain, let me just say "I'm no former POW but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express, which is even worse."
	Bill Cosby perfectly sums up Democrats. They screw us, then hope we don't remember.
	If we don't deal with this illegal alien epidemic then we might as well rename every state New Mexico.
	Obama's response to watching Ant-Man. "He controls hundreds of ants, big deal. I control millions of leeches by promising them free stuff."
	You know why China doesn't have any sitcoms? Because thanks to Obama, when they need a chuckle they just turn on CNN to laugh at America.
	President Obama hates to slow dance because he has no idea how to lead.
	I'm going to see #Trainwreck tonight. I don't know what it's about, but based on the title I'm assuming Obama's presidency.
	I don't care what anyone says, I still think that rapist Bill Cosby sneaked into America from Mexico.  #DonaldForPresident
	I'm not waiting to be President to protect America. I just bought 10,000 bear traps and am currently lining the border with them.
	Rick Perry spent all day trashing me until I gave him a coloring book to distract him.
	Rick Perry became the governor of Texas because it was the only state he could spell.
	John McCain said I've fired up all the crazies. Now I really regret  negotiating his release from that Vietnamese POW camp.
	Have you heard about McDonald's new Obama Value Meal?
Order anything you like and the guy behind you has to pay for it.
	The only time I want to hear "Bush vs. Clinton" is if they're competing against each other on #CelebrityFamilyFeud.
	Jesus turned water into wine. Not to be outdone, Muhammad turned followers into psychotic murderers.  #Chattanooga
	Best moment of the #ESPYS was Brett Farve deciding in his head whether or not to send #CaitlynJenner a dick pic. http://t.co/QSyY8xxg9f
	Inspired by Bruce Jenner's speech at tonight's #ESPYS, Hillary Clinton has decided to get her Apple's Apple shaved down.   #CaitlynJenner
	I'm confused, so transgender is good, but trans fat is bad?    #CaitlynJenner
	Bruce Jenner won't rest until there is a urinal in every ladies' room in America.   #CaitlynJenner #ESPYS
	The #ESPYS should give President Obama a special track and field award for running America into the ground.
	The definition of irony is the #ESPYS giving Bruce Jenner the Courage Award for losing his balls.  #CaitlynJenner
	Instead of revoking Bill Cosby's Medal of Freedom, we should do what he would do. Slip something in his drink and take it when he's asleep.
	Obama: "Major Garrett, I order you to shut up!"  Major Garrett: "I'm not in the military. My parents named me Major just to screw with you."
	Bruce Jenner called up his old buddy OJ Simpson to ask him if he still liked white women.  #CaitlynJenner #ESPYS http://t.co/gSDK3PzNPe

	When I explained to Obama that the Constitution is a living document, he wanted it taken to #PlannedParenthood so it could be aborted.
	Liberals are okay with ISIS murdering people as long as they convince themselves it's just extremely late term abortions.
	Happy #BastilleDay which is also known as  "The Last Time The French Ever Did Their Own Fighting Day."
	Liberals love #PlannedParenthood and abortion because they know that if babies ever get the right to vote, they'll vote Republican.
	I accidentally posted a photo of Nazis today. At least that's better than Obama intentionally allowing murderous illegals in America.
	Hillary Clinton respects Americans even less than Bill Clinton respected their marriage.
	Wayne Brady has been negotiating 5 days a week for years on "Let's Make A Deal." Obama should have sent him to Iran not that idiot Kerry.
	I gave Rosie O'Donnell one of #ElChapo's old shirts to sniff and then sent her off into the wilderness to hunt him down.
	According to my sources the #IranDeal allows them to continue to support terrorism and gives John Kerry a lifetime supply of falafel.
	Did John Kerry even bother to check behind the Iranians' backs to see if they had their fingers crossed during the #IranDeal?
	President Obama finally closed the #IranDeal on nuclear weapons after giving their leaders the secret Muslim handshake.
	Maybe if we explained to all these illegal immigrants about how bad our President actually is, they might not want to come here anymore.
	Scott Walker claims he's an every man.  Well good for him, but if America is going to take on China we need an incredible man as President.
	If that psycho #ElChapo asks where I went, just tell him Chris Christie ate me.
	This #ElChapo thing is really exciting. I haven't pissed off a coke dealer this badly since I bounced a check to one at Studio 54 in 1979.
	I don't want to spread rumors, but #ElChapo was spotted minutes ago volunteering at Jeb Bush's campaign headquarters.
	When me and my large African-American friend hunt down #ElChapo we will most definitely be shaving his head http://t.co/27nsKf94FF
	Hopefully the FBI sends Martin Lawrence in his Big Momma's House fat suit to protect me from #ElChapo.
	I should get a check from Haterade because since I announced my candidacy Liberals are drinking it more than ever.   #DonaldTrump
	Bill Clinton met with Mexican fugitive #ElChapo today to ask for tips on how to escape his marriage to Hillary.
	#ElChapo you think death threats scare me? I've been through two messy divorces so I'm pretty much immune to them.  #DonaldTrump
	Until that psychopath #ElChapo is brought to justice, I've hired this guy to be my full time assassination decoy http://t.co/o6kIP5SR1c
	In Mexico murderers can bribe their way out of Prison. In America  murderers have to have sex with this to escape http://t.co/VKKHaeKF6z
	We have a murderous drug lord headed for the border.  I bet that wall sounds awfully nice right about now.  #ElChapo
	The good news is we don't have to worry about #ElChapo being able to get over our border.  Now try saying that with a straight face.
	I bet #ElChapo is hiding out on MSNBC. That's where I'd go if I wanted to disappear.
	#ElChapo you want a war, you've got one! I've teamed up with Dog the Bounty Hunter and Mark Fuhrman to hunt your ass down.
	Don't mess with me #ElChapo. Thanks to "Celebrity Apprentice" I know tons of desperate washed up celebs willing to kill for cash!
	Mexican drug lord #ElChapo wants to kill me. I'm like Obi One Kenobi. Strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can imagine.
	Don't worry 50 Cent, some of the best chapters of my life were Chapter 11 bankruptcies.  America is the land of the comeback!
	#50Cent I'll buy you lunch and give you a $100 bucks to write me a rap song for my campaign.  Take the offer, you need the cash.
	All I'm saying is under Bush #50Cent went from a nobody to a millionaire.  Under Obama he filed for bankruptcy.  Is that progress?
	Obama's Presidency has been so bad for the black community that even a rapper like 50 Cent worth a $100 million went broke during it.
	Wow, rapper 50 Cent filed for bankruptcy. How long until he changes his rapper name to Broke?
	It's a shame California can't vaccinate kids to prevent them from turning Liberal.
	Money can't buy you class, but it sure as hell helps.
	I worked really hard to get into shape to wear this costume for my campaign poster. But anything for America. http://t.co/mW2wFEw9eI

	Like ones regarding Benghazi, "Who farted?" is a question Hillary Clinton often refuses to answer.
	I'm not the man I used to be. I'm better.
	Yes I did let Bill Cosby give me a Quaalude once, but it was only so I could make it through his horrible standup routine.
	Bill Cosby to host new show "Rape Victims Say the Darndest Things."
	@billmaher better not say this picture is of me and Clint Eastwood campaigning or I'll sue him for 5 million again. http://t.co/4gMd8zAV5C
	I'm not waiting to be President to protect America. I just bought 10,000 bear traps and am currently lining the border with them.
	Don't hate the game or the player. Hate Obama.
	When I'm elected, I'm going to take the tomatoes from Michelle's White House garden and throw them at her and Barack as they move out.
	If Ben Affleck thinks Superman is tough in #BatmanvSuperman wait until he battles wife Jennifer Garner for half his fortune.
	Who am I rooting for in #BatmanvSuperman? I'll give you a hint, it's the one whose parents didn't send him alone illegally to America.
	I'm putting together my own Avengers squad, which includes Mark Cuban, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and the hologram of Steve Jobs.
	Lead by example, not by fear.
	The best thing about America is if you become rich enough you can throw your name on buildings in big gold letters.
	Has anyone ever seen Michelle Obama and Omarosa from 'The Apprentice' in the same room together at the same time? I'm just saying.
	This week's #ComicCon is the only time of the year where space aliens outnumber illegal aliens in San Diego. #SDCC #StarWars
	So sad. Thousands of nerds assaulted at #ComicCon after attendees from nearby BullyCon decided to crash the event.
	I'm so desperate to be President I might even pray to Allah, since it clearly worked for Obama.
	To everyone who calls me a bigot, I want you to know that my best friend is black http://t.co/09GzZTzgoy
	I can't be racist, I own the entire series of 227 on DVD.
	It's a shame Atticus Finch didn't live long enough to be a contributor to Fox News.
	President Obama has been in office 7 years and still hasn't brought Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur's killers to justice!
	If Hillary Clinton cared about women so much then why were female interns in her husband's presidency not only unpaid but sexually harassed?
	Now that Greg Hardy is a Dallas Cowboy, a woman is literally the only one he has a chance of beating in January.
	Greg Hardy if you want to beat up women at least do what Bruce Jenner did and become one so it's a fair fight.
	Screw the primary, I challenge all Republican candidates to a game of Trump, winner takes all! http://t.co/O9wmpfyOz0
	I've actually made money off this whole Mexico controversy. My Donald Trump piñatas are selling faster than I can make them with Latinos.
	"Truth is the ultimate power. When the truth comes around, all the lies have to run and hide."  Ice Cube
	I'm not sure how Ken Stabler died but it's probably safe to say he was murdered by an illegal alien.
	The best way to honor Ken Stabler is to vote for me for President.
	When I'm President anytime an illegal alien murders an American citizen on US soil, I'll consider it an act of war by Mexico. #KateSteinle
	"We can't change the world if we don't change ourselves."  Notorious B.I.G.
	United States of Trump.  Has a nice ring to it.
	First thing I'm going to do as President is look into our super soldier program to see how much it costs to make a real Captain America.
	Hey Jeb Bush, how does my ass look? You'd know because you're behind me in the North Carolina poll.
	If Keith Olbermann wants to keep a low profile for a while I'd recommend he go to MSNBC.
	Don't worry Dallas Mavericks about #DeAndreJordan bailing. Maybe 1 of the 10,000 illegal aliens sneaking into Texas tonight can play center.
	At least I got fired from NBC for sticking up for America, #KeithOlbermann got fired from ESPN because he sucked.
	Now you know why Mark Cuban gives contestants on Shark Tank a 10 second clock to accept his offer.  #DeAndreJordan
	#DeAndreJordan's word is as good as his free throw shooting.
	When I'm President I'm getting rid of Air Force One, because my jet is better.
	Michael Phelps is coming over today to swim in my money pit with me. Sorry haters, but it's good to be rich.
	Ariana Grande declares she hates Americans. Chris Brown do this country a favor and date her.
	Rosie Perez is leaving The View. She's the only one who didn't bother me since I could never understand what she was saying.
	I'm more afraid of a dirty bomb coming over our nonexistent border than I am of seeing Rosie O'Donnell naked. And that's terrifying!
	Actually Jimmy Stewart, every time a bell rings, 500 more illegal aliens sneak into this country.
	How I'd stop ISIS -- Set up fake Muhammad cartoon contests all over the world and when the terrorists show up to wreak havoc, we kill them!
	Disney World had a statue of Bill Cosby but not one of Donald Trump?!  If that's not reason for a boycott I don't know what is.
	John Kerry couldn't handle a Twitter War let alone take on Iran.
	Maybe if we just explain to the illegal aliens how bad our President is they won't want to come to America.
	When I came up with the catch phrase "You're fired," I never anticipated it backfiring on me like this. #MACYS #NBC #Univision #PGA
	I'm working tonight with border control. I'm going to capture a rapist sneaking into America to prove to the world I was right.
	Hopefully my archenemy Rosie O'Donnell will play Jabba the Hutt in the Han Solo movie.
	Why aren't Liberals screaming racism that Han Solo gets his own movie but Chewbacca gets nothing?
	I'm surprised Liberals don't want to remove the back of every bus in America because it brings up too many memories of racism.
	I'm all for gay marriage, as long as they honeymoon at one of my Trump resorts around the globe.
	Kylie Jenner gets revenge on Tyga for cheating on her with a Transgender model by sleeping with his friends Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore.
	I've hired ESPN'S Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith to prepare me for my upcoming debates.
	Why is it taking longer for Subway to drop Jared than it took Macy's and NBC to drop me?  #DonaldTrump
	Thank you Paula Deen for painting your son's face to  give Liberals someone other than me to attack. http://t.co/2MaPyoCq40
	I liked Jared from Subway better when he was fat. At least then kids had a better chance of out running him.
	NBC hates conservatives almost as much as it hates high quality programming.
	Jeb Bush's plan to stop illegal immigration is to marry every woman that comes over the border to make her a citizen.
	It turns out Jared from Subway was never fat, he was just hiding tons of child porn under his sweatshirt.
	All the Liberals who criticized us for invading Iraq, are the same who refuse to criticize Mexico for invading America.
	If Bill Cosby wanted to put women to sleep so he could have sex with them, then he should have just performed his stand up routine.
	Ever since I made those comments about Mexico, every Chalupa I order from Taco Bell taste funny.
	Say what you mean, and mean what you say. And sometimes, say mean things!
	Why is everyone so shocked Bill Cosby is a rapist? He's been raping fashion for years with those ugly ass sweaters.
	When I'm President, I'll save America millions by getting rid of the Secret Service and just have the Nation of Islam protect me instead.
	Saw Jurassic World this weekend. It's a shame we couldn't use Raptors around our borders. Immigration problem solved!
	When I'm President one way I'll raise revenue is by selling off naming rights for our National Parks to corporate sponsors.
	#HappyBirthdayAshton I'm still waiting for you to tell me Obama's presidency has just been one long awful episode of Punk'd.
	Biggest difference between President Clinton and President Obama is Clinton hid a chubby intern under his desk and Obama hides his Koran.
	It's too bad Kobe Bryant doesn't run ISIS, since he can't recruit anyone.  #LaMarcusAldridge #Spurs
	Happy Independence Day. Enjoy it because if Obama and the Liberals have their way we might not have freedom next year.  #4thofJuly
	The rumors are true, I'm directing Marvel's "Black Panther."
	Let's make Liberals happy by giving them a blank Bible so they can just write down what we should believe in.
	Bill Clinton married a man long before it was fashionable.  Just kidding Hillary.
	If I'm as racist as my critics say, why would I own the #missuniverse pageant? Even someone not from the human race can enter.
	If you see a suspicious person on the #4thofJuly, it's probably just a Democrat.
	@realDonaldTrump And we haven't even played our Trump card yet!
	New York wants to get rid of me but keep all the mosques.  God bless America!  #DonaldTrump
	Obama needs to send in troops to squash the #RedditRevolt before ISIS shows up and takes over like it did in Iraq.
	Screw it! If I don't win this election, I'm just buying myself an island and declaring myself king.
	America Ferrera is now taking shots at me. Unfortunately I have no idea who she is because I only watch popular movies and television shows.
	Thanks to Obama not protecting our borders, America is now easier to get into than University of Phoenix.
	Just saw #MagicMikeXXL.  Channing Tatum may be a Democrat but he sure dances like a Republican.
	If you see someone trying to burn an American Flag, help them out by tossing a Molotov cocktail in their direction.
	It's going to come out eventually this election, so I'll just spit it out. I'm a big fan of Nickelback. Deal with it people and move on.
	I've never touched alcohol in my life.  I've also never touched an unattractive woman.
	I'm getting together for drinks tonight with the cast of #Hannibal to commiserate about how much we hate NBC!
	Sorry if I'm a little tired today, I was up all night helping my buddy #BenAffleck work on his http://t.co/5dHuBz2hbA  profile.
	Another #Sharkattack in America. If I'm elected President I'll get on a boat with Richard Dreyfuss and hunt these monsters down!
	Truth behind #JobsReport - Those were 223,000 new jobs were blowjobs from people celebrating the Supreme Court's decision on gay marriage.
	When I become President I'm going to change the term "Community Organizer" to "Guy who doesn't want to work and just live off race-baiting."
	For the talent portion of #MissUSA I'm going to have the girls read the Constitution out loud so a Liberal watching can learn something.
	I'd personally like to thank the channel Reelz for acting like we live in a free Democracy and airing my #MissUSA pageant.
	Anyone want to go see Magic Mike XXL with me this weekend?  The media will never let me live it down if I go alone.
	Arnold needs to stop. He's too old and is only embarrassing himself at this point, just like Bernie Sanders.  #TerminatorGenisys
	I can't see what's happening at the Navy Yard. Hey Bree Newsome climb up the flagpole and take a look.
	Sleeping with hookers isn't illegal as long as you film it.  The law considers that a porno shoot.
	Damn, I ran out of things to say.........
	At least Boss Hog can finally rest in peace now that the Dukes of Hazzard have been stopped.
	At this rate it's going to be a long campaign.  #MACYS #NBC #Univision
	Don't be all that you can be. Be better!
	Instead of selling the Trump Collection, #Macys is now selling the wool Liberals are using to pull over American's eyes!
	Another reason why America should vote for me -- This will be our First Lady http://t.co/9k73nDEfeR

	Ironically, when I heard the news this morning about #Macys, I was still in the pajamas I bought from Saks Fifth Avenue.
	I don't need NBC to do "Celebrity Apprentice." All I need is a few cameras and a handful of washed up actors, singers, and athletes.
	It's days like today when I really miss having my good friend Tupac Shakur around to ask for his advice.  #Macys
	The worst thing about this #Macys fiasco is that I'll never be able to watch "Miracle on 34th Street" the same way again.
	For all my critics who call me a joke and I can't be taken seriously --That's exactly how Putin and ISIS feel about President Obama!
	If Macy's is so high and mighty, then I challenge them to donate all my remaining Trump Collection in stores to homeless shelters nationwide
	Just to set the record straight, I'm not the one burning black churches, I've only been burning all my bridges.  #DonaldTrump
	To all my haters who want to see me financially ruined -- I just found $25 million underneath my couch cushions, so suck it!!!
	Macy's will sell convicted felon Martha Stewart's merchandise but not mine? God bless America.
	The most painful part of today's news is the fact #Macys is launching a Hillary Clinton menswear line.
	Instead of opening a Cuban embassy, Obama should focus on protecting the ones we've already got. #benghazi
	Screw William H. Macy! I don't need his lousy department stores.  #Macys
	Macy's wants to cut all Trump ties. Luckily for them, it's easy to do since all those ties were made in China with cheap fabric.
	I'd hate to see what #ISIS has to do to finally get Obama's attention.
	I've been reading Hillary's emails. There's a sad one she wrote to the website Ashley Madison begging them to cancel Bill's membership.
	Obama would rather rename every state New Mexico than seriously try and combat illegal immigration.
	If this was a bad 90s movie, the FBI would have to go to jail and ask Dylann Roof for his help. #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches
	#JimCarrey is still anti-vaccination and on the basis of his most recent films, he's still anti-good screenplays.
	Now that the Confederate Flag is gone, let's make Obama take down the Manchurian Candidate poster hanging in his bedroom.
	Instead of a wall, let's barricade the border with the millions of unread copies of "Audacity of Hope" and "Dreams of My Father."
	If Bruce Jenner can become a woman, then maybe there's hope for Hillary Clinton.
	Hillary Clinton doesn't want to release her financial records, because she doesn't want America to see how much Bill spent on fleshlights.
	I didn't mean to say Mexico sends the rapists over the border. I meant to say Mexico sends therapists but my teleprompter messed up.
	How can Bobby Jindal take on Chris Christie? I thought Indians worship cows, not run against them.
	It is a complete lie that Rick Perry can't read. He just can't read very well.
	I asked Chris Christie his thoughts on Greece. He said he loves it, the more on his food, the better.
	Chris Christie admits the only reason he got so close to Obama in 2012 was because the President had bacon in his pockets.
	Is this the home of the President of the United States or the King of Candyland? http://t.co/MyXhGrOedO
	Don't piss me off Hillary, or I'll finally let Bill be a Miss Universe judge.

	Say what you mean, and mean what you say.  And sometimes, say mean things!
	When I'm elected, I'm going to take the tomatoes from Michelle's White House garden and throw them at her and Barack as they move out.
	Chelsea Clinton makes $65,000 per speech. She'll need every cent for her therapy bills after growing up with Bill and Hillary as parents.
	Chris Christie says he's running for President.  I bet that's the only running he ever plans on doing. #Christie2016
	Go screw yourself NBC! I'm joining ABC's "Shark Tank!"  #YoureFired
	NBC's Jimmy Fallon did America a great service. Thanks to his lack of humor, children nationwide no longer want to stay up past eleven.
	If it comes down to watching NBC or paint drying, most Americans would agree the paint wins every time!  #YoureFired
	I would say NBC is going down, but when you've already hit rock bottom as a network, you can't go down any further. #YoureFired
	NBC hates America!  Why else would it torture its citizens with horrible sitcoms like "Whitney" "Guys With Kids" and "The New Normal?"
	After what NBC did to Conan O'Brien I should have expected this. The Peacock Network has a vendetta against guys with great hair!
	NBC will let Kathie Lee and Hoda get drunk on air every morning, yet I'm too reckless for their network?   #YoureFired
	I was so pissed about the Supreme Court that I spent the entire weekend watching "Pelican Brief" on a continuous loop.
	It's bad enough NBC told me "You're Fired," but did they have to send me home in a cab too?
	I just pissed on all the giant red chairs on the set of "The Voice." Screw you NBC!
	I'm going to do to NBC what I did to Vince McMahon when he tried to take me on. http://t.co/dNGXjfsvNe
	Now that NBC fired me, looks like I'm going to have to take ABC's offer of playing the uptight white neighbor on "Black-ish."
	I would ask America to boycott NBC but they were never watching it in the first place.
	NBC was still pissed I turned down the lead role of Reddington on "The Blacklist."
	NBC will keep Ice-T who wrote a song called "Copkiller"on their network but not me?!
	I'd rather go to a real network, not stay at the one who put on "Animal Practice." http://t.co/C9UuFuZSNf
	NBC fires me for telling the truth and keeps Brian Williams for lying.  #DonaldTrump

	Dylann Roof keeps asking the guards in jail to turn off the #BETAwards, but they told him "Tough luck, the other inmates want to watch it."
	I'm officially tired of homeless people with witty cardboard signs.  If you're that clever get a job!
	The #BETAwards should keep the awards on top of a flagpole and then have Bree Newsome climb up and hand them to each winner.

	For all my critics who call me a joke and I can't be taken seriously --That's exactly how Putin and ISIS feel about President Obama!
	It's a sad day in America when I'll feel more comfortable watching "Manchurian Candidate" than I do watching CNN.
	NBC the network that allowed pathological liar Brian Williams to return to work wants me not to run for President so I don't embarrass them.
	Nothing shows how badly Obama wants to transform America like the fact he changed the color of the White House. http://t.co/7TV3J233G0
	Now that the Confederate Flag is down, let's hang Dylann Roof on the flag pole.

	Maybe if we let illegal immigrants get treated at Walter Reed, President Obama would make sure the place got fixed up.
	I hate to see what ISIS has to do in order to get Obama's attention.

	The bad news for Dylann Roof is he'll spend the rest of his life in prison, the good news is thanks to Obama he now can marry his cellmate.
	President Obama is just like Bill Cosby, he tricked us into drinking the Kool-Aid then fucked us!
	Inspired by Bruce Jenner, Hillary Clinton has decided to get her Adam's Apple shaved down before the election.
	The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.  His second greatest trick was getting Obama elected.

	Bill Clinton married a man long before it was fashionable.  Just kidding Hillary.
	Obama is taking this gay rights thing too far. He just replaced his cabinet with the Village People.
