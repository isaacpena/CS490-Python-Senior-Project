During secret briefing, I asked if Russians hacked election, why didn't Putin win instead of me? Briefers were stunned at my smart insight.
Top secret briefing finally over. I'm sure I convinced them that someone in the room has no clue about "intelligence."#RussianHackers
I asked the briefers "how do we know that hackers weren't time travelers from the future?" NO ONE could respond. #russianhacking
Head of FBI requested that I stop sending tweets about top secret briefing. He has no respect for me! #russianhacking
20 people in this briefing room, not one of them has complimented me on my new tie. Unbelievable!!! #russianhacking
Now listening to CIA operative, claims he has first hand knowledge of Russian hacks. I bet he's a double agent. #russianhacking
FBI, CIA, homeland security speakers, etc. Desperate to get my attention during briefing. Not one of them is good looking.  #RussianHacking
