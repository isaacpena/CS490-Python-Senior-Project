	Very big crybaby Colin Crapernick has filed a grievance against NFL for not giving him a job -- Very delusional son of a bitch!
	Prepare yourselves for many, many tweets about Colin Crapernick's lack of job after A.Rodgers injury. Very bad stats - libs don't care!
	It is time for NFL to drain the swamp of corrupt refs. Clearly cheating for the Patriots - more corrupt than Crooked Hillary Clinton!
	People are just now starting to see how weak and untalented the NY @Giants are. Viewers beware. May be worse than even @Browns!
	My warmest thoughts and prayers go out to Luke Kuechly after suffering his millionth career concussion. Very sad!

	It's a SHAME to see the NFL blackballing Jay Cutler! He has thrown for 32,467 yards and 208 TDs! Liberals won't talk about it! VERY sad!
	Religious Liberty Order does NOT apply to Patriots fans worshipping Tom Brady (a system QB)! Pats went 11-5 without him in 2008. Overrated!

	... not to mention the 25 point lead the Falcons blew in the Battle of Bull Run! COMPLETE game changer! Should have NEVER happened!
	The Colts' GM is draining the swamp today to fix his WEAK team! VERY good to cut 10 OVERPAID players and BENCH WARMERS! Smart!
	The Civil War could have EASILY been prevented if the Seahawks just ran the ball with Marshawn Lynch at the 1 yard line. Very sad!
	If the Patriots win the SB this year, I will make my own team to beat them. They will be fantastic and go 16-0 every year, guaranteed!
	Liberals who have never even watched football think Colin Kaepernick deserves an NFL contract solely based on his beliefs. Very WRONG!

	Jimmy Garoppolo's Instagram account got hacked. We can't be sure if it was the Russians or the CIA. Sad!
	WikiLeaks needs to get their priorities straight and leak Bill Belichick's and Tom Brady's emails!
	It's ironic that @RealSkipBayless has "real" in his Twitter handle, because all I ever see from him is FAKE news! Dishonest media!
	It doesn't matter how many times the Rams redesign their uniforms, will still be a DISASTER on the field. Sad! https://t.co/k0xkhmlzcd
	Colin Kaepernick says he'll stand for the National Anthem next season now that he's a AWFUL free agent who needs a job! Very sad!
	I'm surprised no NFL GMs have asked me who to draft this year. I would only draft the best players. Sad!
	I'm signing a bill this week that allows me to deport anyone who still makes "YOU LIKE THAT" Kirk Cousins jokes.
	Had I known earlier that Adrian Peterson was hitting free agency, I would have named him my Secretary of Education. Bummer!
	Kyrie Irving thinks the Earth is flat, and he may be onto something. Very smart!

	I'd like to know how much the Patriots paid the refs for this game. So many calls. Sad!
	I didn't vote for Matt Ryan to be NFL MVP! #NotMyMVP
	I'm expanding my travel ban to also include annoying Patriots fans!
	I'd rather watch paint dry on my wall than watch the NFL Pro Bowl.
	#NotMyAFCChampions
	The Packers and Steelers gave us their best Hillary Clinton impressions this weekend. Sad!
	A lot of people hate the Patriots, but I love them because their approval rating makes mine seem high!
	My sources say the Russians leaked the Steelers playbook to the dishonest Patriots. It sure looks like it! Sad!
	I can't help but notice the Patriots have a lot of white receivers. If I was their GM, I would never hear the end of it!
	Packers fans better start marching for Packers' rights. They are getting severely oppressed by the Falcons! Sad!

	What time is the Carolina Panthers game this weekend? I can't find it on the schedule. Weird!
	The main difference between me and Pete Carroll is that I would've given the ball to Marshawn Lynch at the 1 yard line!
	The Texans may as well stop trying. Vladimir Putin is a Patriots fan, and already hacked the NFL and rigged this game. Smh!
	In a socialist NFL, we'd be watching the Browns vs Jaguars in the playoffs this weekend! Pathetic! #HOUvsNE
	Hillary had more passing yards, but I finished the game with more points. https://t.co/i2JrGhN1bC
	The Texans have about as much of a chance of beating the Patriots as Gary Johnson did in the election. None!
	Spoiler alert: The Patriots are about to beat the Texans tonight. Super predictable! #HOUvsNE
	If I was the Seahawks coach, we would be up 42-0. We would be winning so much, the fans would be begging us to stop winning so much. Bigly!
	"The Seahawks are going to the NFC Championship game" https://t.co/Di9hNVsc3G
	Russell Wilson = Hillary Clinton 
Matt Ryan = Me
	Just a couple years ago, the Seahawks were a Super Bowl contender. It's a shame to see a failing organization! Sad! #SEAvsATL
	Pete Carroll should spend less time chewing gum and more time coaching. All chew, chew chew - no results! #SEAvsATL
	I'll take it. Done deal! https://t.co/NDCy6AoIkC
	.@TraeTracks https://t.co/eORI0Mp8Fn
	A close friend within the @Chiefs organization informed me they're happy the weather delayed their playoff loss to the Steelers. Sad!
	Los Angeles collecting multiple WEAK NFL teams might help them actually get 8 wins per season. Very smart!
	I know way more about football than any NFL coach or referee does!
	It's a shame to see the Chargers' jobs moving to Los Angeles. It's time to impose a 50% tax on all Chargers jerseys going into San Diego!
	I'm looking forward to some great playoff football this weekend, minus the FAKE playoff teams like the Texans. Just awful!
	When someone tries to tell me I can't build a wall around the AFC South. https://t.co/276Ddiqm75
	I refuse to take any questions from Browns players because their organization is absolutely terrible!
	My first order of business is to repeal and replace the San Francisco 49ers. Possibly with a more competitive pee-wee football team!
	What's so bad about being friends with Vladimir Putin? It's not like I'm friends with Colin Kaepernick!
	Grab 'em by the Odell Beckham Jr.
	Alshon Jeffery guaranteed a Bears' Super Bowl victory next year. We're going to get him mental help, and Mexico will pay for it!
	Several sources say that Vladimir Putin is a Clemson fan, and rigged the #NationalChampionship against Alabama. Wild!
	We're going to build a wall, and Odell Beckham Jr. isn't allowed anywhere near it.
	Chip Kelly... You're fired!
	Turning the economy around should be easy. Turning the Browns around, that's a whole different story!
	It's no coincidence that the year I'm elected, the Panthers miss the playoffs. I'm already making football great again!
	Merry Christmas, NFL! My first act as commissioner will be to deport the Chargers for losing to the Browns.
	I'm going to make The Jaguars pay for the wall.
	Going to start the hashtag #NotMyChampions if my team doesn't win the Super Bowl this year.
	Change of plans... We're building the wall around the AFC South
	It's a shame that the Russians would go to such lengths to ensure the Patriots destroyed the Jets. https://t.co/FG0v7p1lhx
	Don't worry, I'll be sending Roger Goodell to jail with Hillary.
	Several Dolphins players knelt during the National Anthem today.

	"Tom Brady throws the ball to Gronk too much, he's discriminating against non-white receivers"

	Colin Kaepernick has a $126M contract to suck at football. 

Elect me NFL Commissioner, and I'll deport him to the CFL!
	Expecting Tony Romo not to get injured is like expecting Hillary Clinton to tell the truth.

	The Bills haven't made the playoffs since 1999, after going to the Super Bowl 4 times in the 90s. 

I blame @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton
	Everyone needs to calm down about me saying Obama founded ISIS. At least I didn't say he founded the Browns.
	With football season around the corner, I can imagine the Patriots will be contacting Hillary Clinton about how to get away with cheating.
	It appears some fireworks have accidentally caught a KD jersey on fire. What a shame. https://t.co/PxDfbrjR0K
	I bet if Crooked Hillary's emails were released, they would contain new evidence regarding DeflateGate.
	I think it's time we do a background check on Muhammed Wilkerson, because frankly his name freaks me out.

	To be frank, @Chiefs, your safety Husain Abdullah's name makes me nervous.
	Under my leadership, referees will no longer be necessary. If a player violates league rules, they will be immediately shipped to Canada
	Things I'd do that Goodell didn't:

Suspend Beckham Jr 4 games for his hair. 
Deny the Redskins entry into the playoffs. 
Deport the Browns.
	I still need to see proof that terrorists aren't to blame for the explosion of Jason Pierre-Paul's hand
	Enough with these NFL games in London. When I'm Commissioner, I'm keeping the National Football League in OUR nation
	When I'm Commissioner: Instead of getting the 1st overall draft pick, the worst team in the league will be deported to the CFL.
	As Commissioner, I'm going to raise the walls around Lambeau Field. Nobody will be getting over them
	Chip Kelly, you're fired
	I haven't seen any white cornerbacks in the NFL. That will need to change when I'm Commissioner
